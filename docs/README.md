# LUGX Documentation — Master Structural Index

This index maps every document under `docs/`. It is a **structural map only**:
operational documentation rules live outside this file — see
[DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md](./DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md) for repository-visible
authoring standards (enforced locally via `.agents/rules/`). Source code and
automated tests remain the single source of truth for all technical claims.

### 2.8. Foundation (`foundation/`) — Founding Baseline Record

> **Immutable historical methodology record** — authored before any code was
> written. Preserved verbatim; it documents how the project's pillars were
> established, **not** the current system behavior. For divergences between this
> founding design and the implemented reality, see
> [`foundation/DESIGN_VS_REALITY.md`](./foundation/DESIGN_VS_REALITY.md).

- **Sync deep-dive:** `sync-lifecycle-architecture` → `queue-gc-rollback-architecture` → `three-way-conflict-resolution` → [sync-api.md](./reference/sync-api.md) → `editor-sync-orchestration`
- **AI deep-dive:** `ai-streaming-protocol` → `ai-quota-reservation-lifecycle` → `ai-atomic-commit-architecture` → [ai-key-rotation-and-resilience.md](./specs/ai-key-rotation-and-resilience.md)
- **Security review:** [security-and-rate-limiting.md](./architecture/security/security-and-rate-limiting.md) → `file-ownership-and-versioning` → [test-database-safety.md](./records/incidents/test-database-safety.md)
