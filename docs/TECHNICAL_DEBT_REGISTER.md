## TD-01 — Integration tests run against the live database — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-08-24)

- **Original debt:** `vitest.setup.ts` loaded `.env.local`, so DB integration suites executed
  against the same Neon instance as the app instead of an isolated test branch
  (`TEST_DATABASE_URL` / Neon branch).
- **Decision reversal:** the earlier "isolation declined" decision is REVERSED
  (owner: project lead). Phase 10 closed on 2026-08-24 with full isolation:
  every Postgres-backed suite now runs exclusively on a dedicated Neon branch
  (`TEST_DATABASE_URL`) behind a fail-closed guard, and unit/contract suites
  are structurally separated from LIVE suites (`npm run test` vs `npm run test:live`).
- **Second layer retained (not a substitute):** placeholder-pattern scoping,
  guarded `cleanupTestUsers()`, and per-suite id ownership remain as defense-in-depth.
- Full architecture, guard rules and closure evidence:
  [`reference/test-database-isolation.md`](reference/test-database-isolation.md).
  Background incident: [`records/incidents/test-database-safety.md`](records/incidents/test-database-safety.md).

## TD-02 — Quota TTL sweeper is not wired to any scheduler — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 17)

- **Debt:** `expireStaleReservations()` (`ai-ops.ts`) transitions abandoned
  `reserved` rows to `expired` and restores counters, but nothing in production
  invoked it.
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 17 by deploying `/api/cron/expire-reservations`
  protected by `CRON_SECRET` and scheduling it via `.github/workflows/cron.yml`.
  Covered by unit tests in `src/test/infrastructure/cron-expire-reservations.test.ts` and
  verified against real database rows on the isolated Neon test branch in Phase 18
  (`src/test/infrastructure/cron-expire-reservations.live.test.ts`).

## TD-03 — No audit trail for destructive database operations

- **Debt:** there is no audit log capturing who/what triggered deletions or
  tombstones (a trigger-based `files_audit` table was proposed).
- **Decision:** **declined** for now (owner: project lead) to avoid extra write
  load on Neon for prevention of a since-resolved issue.

## TD-04 — Pre-existing lint errors in two legacy test files — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-08-25)

- **Debt:** `file-ops.ownership.test.ts` (3× `no-explicit-any`, unused import) and
  `ai-atomic-commit.integration.test.ts` (1× `no-explicit-any`, unused imports)
  fail strict ESLint rules.
- **Resolution:** fixed in the Phase 11 debt-cleanup round — cycle-detection maps now
  use a typed `CycleFolderRow` alias instead of `any`, unused imports pruned
  (`generateETagSync`, `and`, `isNull`), and the Supabase session mock cast via
  `Awaited<ReturnType<typeof getUser>>`. `npx eslint` exits clean on both files.

## TD-05 — Stop-action settlement latency — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-09-19)

- **Debt:** "Stop Generation" previously awaited the quota settlement round-trip (~100–300 ms) before aborting the upstream stream, so the server-side disconnect refund deterministically no-ops with `already_committed`.
- **Resolution (2026-09-19):**
  - Resolved via the Canonical Dual-Side Inversion Protocol in Phase 20 technical debt round.
  - In `src/app/api/ai/stream/route.ts`, implemented `handleClientDisconnect`: when client aborts post-TTFT (after tokens were streamed), the server autonomously settles the reservation via `commitAIReservation(operationId)`, while early disconnects pre-TTFT are refunded (`refundAIReservation`).
  - In Phase 11 (2026-10-02), client financial authority was completely revoked: client hook `useAIStream` was stripped of all settlement RPC invocations (`commitAIReservation`, `settleReservationAsConsumed`). `stopStream()` aborts immediately (0ms) and dismantles ghost decorations instantly without dispatching any network settlement calls, leaving 100% of stream settlement to the server stream handler (`cancel()` and `req.signal.aborted`).
  - Upstream Gemini model generation terminates instantly at socket level, eliminating token bleed and guaranteeing 0ms UI stop latency.
  - Verified via dedicated test suites `src/test/ai/ai-stream-abort-latency.test.ts`, `src/test/ai/ai-client-authority-revocation.test.ts`, and `src/test/ai/ai-authoritative-stream-settlement.test.ts` (100% pass rate).

## TD-06 — Dead `'error'` member in the `SyncStatus` union — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-08-25)

- **Debt:** `SyncStatus` (`src/lib/sync/sync-manager.ts`) declares an `| 'error'`
  state, but no code path ever calls `setStatus('error')`. The manager emits only
  `idle`, `loading`, `queued`, `syncing`, `conflict`, `failed`, `stopped`, and
  `offline`. The sync state-machine documentation therefore (correctly) omits it.
- **Impact:** none at runtime today; the dead union member invites future misuse
  and confuses consumers switching exhaustively on the status.
- **Resolution:** the dead member was removed in the Phase 11 debt-cleanup round.
  Repo-wide audit found zero producers/consumers of `SyncStatus['error']`; every
  other `'error'` literal belongs to the unrelated `FileOpResult.status` union.
  If a terminal sync-error state is ever needed, re-add it together with a real
  transition and consumer coverage.
  The exhaustive `Record<SyncStatus, ...>` display map in `sync-indicator.tsx`
  was trimmed of its dead `error` row accordingly.

## TD-07 — Real-browser E2E coverage for editor recovery & vault encryption journeys — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 19)

- **Debt:** Real-browser browser journeys across authentication, file system, CodeMirror 6 BiDi editing, offline-first sync, AI streaming & quota reservations, zero-knowledge vault lifecycle & lock state, Stripe billing, and tenant isolation were previously asserted via jsdom integration suites or manual checklists.
- **Resolution:** Fully resolved in Phase 19 with Playwright + Chromium automated test infrastructure (`@playwright/test` v1.63.0) and dedicated Next.js test runner harness. 14 test specs covering all 15 journeys in `e2e/specs/` execute deterministically against the isolated Neon database branch (`TEST_DATABASE_URL`) with zero flakiness across consecutive validation runs (15/15 passed in Run 1 and Run 2). Covered journeys include SSR authentication cookies, nested file tree/trash, pure Markdown & Arabic auto-RTL, offline sync & conflict dialog, magic byte security & PDF pipeline, AI NDJSON streaming & atomic commit, quota refunding, 412 collision handling, AES-GCM-256 vault creation & deterministic AAD binding, multi-modal auto-lock & RAM clearing, AI shield gatekeeper (HTTP 403), Stripe durable event ledger, and tenant isolation with 404 anti-enumeration masking.

## TD-08 — Database Driver Protocol Mismatch in CI Containers — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-08-29)

- **Debt:** Legacy `src/lib/db/index.ts` was hardcoded to `@neondatabase/serverless` (`neon-http`), which dispatches queries over HTTPS port 443. When running inside GitHub Actions CI service containers or local Docker (`postgres:16-alpine`), connections failed with `ECONNREFUSED ::1:443`.
- **Resolution:** Replaced with a Smart Hybrid Database Client in `src/server/db/client.ts` (re-exported via `src/server/db/index.ts`) that dynamically detects the target host: uses `neon-http` for Neon Cloud and standard `pg.Pool` (`drizzle-orm/node-postgres`) over TCP on port 5432 for local Docker and CI containers. All 7 stages of the CI pipeline (including Stage 6 Playwright E2E browser testing) pass deterministically.

## TD-09 — Rollup Mixed Exports and Vite ConfigLoader Native Deprecation Warnings — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-09-05)

- **Debt:** Running `npm run test` triggered two terminal warnings:
  1. `[MIXED_EXPORTS] Entry module "vitest.config.ts" is using named and default exports together.`
  2. `(!) Your Vite config uses features that are unsupported by 'configLoader: native'... ESM syntax in a file loaded as CommonJS...`
- **Resolution:**
  - Extracted shared test suite arrays (`LIVE_TEST_FILES`, `CLOUD_E2E_FILES`) into a dedicated Single Source of Truth (`vitest.constants.mts`), restricting config files strictly to default exports (`export default defineConfig(...)`).
  - Migrated configuration files to Native ESM (`vitest.config.mts` and `vitest.live.config.mts`), replaced CommonJS `__dirname` with standard `import.meta.dirname`, and specified explicit `.mjs` import extensions for TypeScript module resolution.
  - Silenced all terminal warnings with zero collateral impact on root Next.js CommonJS toolchains. All test files execute cleanly with zero warnings and 100% pass rate.

## TD-10 — Offline Extraction of IndexedDB Device Trust Envelope (Accepted Risk for PIN / Mitigated via WebAuthn PRF)

- **Debt:** In "Trust This Device" mode when selecting the software 6-digit PIN option, the Master Key is wrapped via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600,000 iterations) and persisted in browser `IndexedDB` (`device_trust_envelope`). While in-browser access is rate-limited and locked after 5 failed attempts (destroying the envelope), this protection is enforced exclusively by client-side JavaScript. If an adversary gains physical or local OS root access to the machine and extracts the browser's SQLite/LevelDB database files from disk, the software-level attempt counter does not apply offline. An attacker with dedicated GPU resources can brute-force the $10^6$ PIN keyspace offline.
- **Decision / Status:** **Accepted Risk for PIN / Progressive Enhancement Mitigated** (owner: project lead / architecture). In standard web browser environments without native OS secure hardware enclaves (TPM / Secure Enclave), web storage is inherently bound to host OS security. Implementing server-dependent rate-limiting for PIN entry would violate the application's offline-first architecture.
- **User Responsibility Invariant:** Physical and device hardware security rests 100% on the user when choosing to enable "Trust This Device" via software PIN. The UI mandates explicit user acknowledgment of this trust boundary before activation.
- **Implemented Mitigations & Dual Architecture:**
  - **Hardware-Bound Biometrics (WebAuthn PRF — ✅ IMPLEMENTED 2026-09-05):** Integrated W3C WebAuthentication Level 3 PRF extension (`src/lib/sync/webauthn-prf.ts`). Users on supported platforms (Windows Hello TPM 2.0, Apple Touch ID / Face ID Secure Enclave, Android Titan M2 / StrongBox) can choose Hardware Biometrics instead of a PIN. In this mode, the key encryption key is derived directly within the hardware security chip via HMAC-SHA-256 and HKDF, providing 100% physical immunity against offline `IndexedDB` disk extraction.
  - **Dual Selector in UI:** Both `TrustDeviceModal` and `VaultUnlockModal` (Password tab) present dual options: Hardware Biometrics (with dynamic hardware capability detection and diagnostic guidance) and 6-Digit PIN (software fallback).
  - **Default Zero-Trace Policy:** For high-threat environments, shared workstations, or untrusted hardware, users can remain on the default **Level 1: Strict Zero-Trace (Volatile RAM-Only)** mode, where no cryptographic key material or envelope is ever written to disk/storage.
  - **Remote Central Revocation:** Remote revocation via `deviceTrustEpoch` (backed by PostgreSQL migration `0009_add_device_trust_epoch.sql`) atomically invalidates both PRF and PIN device trust envelopes across all devices simultaneously from any authenticated session via cryptographic AAD binding.

## TD-11 — Full Repository ESLint Hygiene & Zero-Warning Determinism — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-09-07)

- **Debt:** Post-Vault implementation codebase accumulated 104 ESLint issues (3 errors, 101 warnings) across 23 files, primarily consisting of loose types (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`), dead imports/variables (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`), React 19 hook lifecycle purity violations (`react-hooks/refs`, `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`, and `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`), and syntax invariants (`prefer-const`).
- **Resolution:**
  - Strongly typed all cryptographic worker RPC action payloads (`CryptoWorkerResponsePayloads`), indexedDB vault profiles (`UserVaultProfile`), and database encryption metadata (`FileEncryptionMetadata`).
  - Pruned all unused imports, variables, and dead mocks across server actions, sync engines, UI modals, and test suites.
  - Resolved React 19 hook purity issues in `use-sync.ts` by leveraging a getter property to access `idbManagerRef.current` without executing during render phase.
  - Achieved `0 problems` (`0 errors, 0 warnings`) on `npm run lint` while preserving 100% test pass rate across the entire verification harness.

## TD-12 — Auth Sign-Out Cache Invalidation & Chromium Socket Pool Saturation on Stale Session — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-09-19)

- **Debt:** When signing out via `signOut()` (`src/server/actions/auth-actions.ts`), the action performs `redirect("/")` without executing `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` and without explicitly clearing Supabase auth session cookies from `cookieStore`. Additionally, `src/proxy.ts` called `supabase.auth.getUser()` on all routes (including the public `/` path) without an AbortSignal timeout watchdog, and dropped cookie-deletion headers on `NextResponse.redirect`.
- **Impact:** When a revoked or stale session token was sent by the browser post-logout, `@supabase/ssr` attempted token recovery over the network, incurring high latency (~7.5s) before failing with `AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token`. Rapid browser reloads/retries caused client aborts, leaving sockets trapped in `CLOSE_WAIT` on Chromium-based browsers (Chrome & Brave). This saturated Chromium's per-host socket pool (`kDefaultMaxSocketsPerGroup = 6`), causing subsequent requests to hang indefinitely ("Waiting for available socket").
- **Resolution (2026-09-19):**
  - Updated `signOut()` in `src/server/actions/auth-actions.ts` to invalidate stale RSC layouts via `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` and proactively clear all `sb-*` session cookies from `cookieStore` prior to redirection.
  - Introduced Fast-Path routing in `src/proxy.ts` that completely bypasses `getUser()` network calls on public routes (e.g. `/`, static assets) and on `/login` when no auth cookies exist.
  - Equipped `getUser()` in `src/proxy.ts` with an `AbortSignal.timeout(2500)` watchdog race that fails closed gracefully into an unauthenticated null user without socket stalling.
  - Implemented `copyCookiesAndRedirect` helper ensuring all `Set-Cookie` directives (including deletions from `@supabase/ssr`) are retained and returned to the client browser on 307 redirects and 401 API responses.
  - Verified via dedicated unit test suites (`src/test/auth/auth-signout.test.ts` and `src/test/auth/proxy.test.ts`), maintaining 100% test pass rate and clean ESLint status.

## TD-13 — Systemic Fail-Open Defaults on Redis Outages & Unprotected Cron Execution — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 13 / 2026-10-02)

- **Debt:**
  - Rate limiting logic across all routes (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`) unconditionally fell open upon Redis connectivity failures, allowing unauthorized bursts and potential LLM provider quota drainage.
  - The `RateLimiter` executed `zadd` unconditionally before inspecting current counts, trapping retrying clients in infinite locked loops (`LUGX-079`).
  - Unconfigured environments instantiated a client pointing to `placeholder-redis.upstash.io`, triggering slow DNS timeouts and silent fail-open bypasses.
  - CI executed with an incompatible Redis container image (`redis:7-alpine` expecting RESP over TCP rather than HTTP REST), forcing all guard paths down the fallback branch (`LUGX-093`).
  - Scheduled maintenance routes (`/api/cron/expire-reservations` and `/api/cron/purge-deleted`) had no distributed locking mechanism, risking overlapping runs and race conditions (`LUGX-096`).
- **Resolution:**
  - Configured explicit per-tier policies: `fail-closed` for sensitive endpoints (`AI_STREAM`, `AUTH`) returning HTTP 503 Service Unavailable with `Retry-After: 10`, and `fail-open` for offline continuity endpoints (`SYNC_API`, `FILE_API`).
  - Re-ordered rate limiter execution to perform conditional `zadd`: tokens are consumed strictly when the current count is within limits, eliminating the client retry lock trap.
  - Added `isRedisConfigured()` to `src/lib/redis.ts` ensuring immediate degraded fail-closed handling without DNS timeouts in unconfigured environments.
  - Deployed `hiett/serverless-redis-http:latest` Upstash REST proxy in CI Stage 4, translating HTTP REST requests to Redis RESP on port 8079.
  - Implemented `acquireCronLock` (`src/lib/cron/lock.ts`) backed by atomic Redis `SET ... NX EX` with in-memory TTL fallback, enabling concurrent cron runs to skip gracefully with HTTP 200 `{ skipped: true }`.
  - Enforced strict hermetic test isolation in `src/test/load-test-env.ts`: unit tests (`npm run test`) never load `.env.local` or `.env` and run exclusively against dummy Redis and Postgres placeholders, while live tests (`npm run test:live`) exclusively load isolated test branch credentials.
  - Regulated Vitest concurrency (`maxWorkers: 3` on Windows) to prevent CPU thread starvation and eliminate worker spawn timeouts.
  - Verified across all unit and live database integration test suites with 100% pass rate.

## TD-14 — In-Flight Lost Updates, Queue Coalescing Pollution & Destructive Push Failure Rollbacks — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 14 / 2026-10-03)

- **Debt:**
  - Upon server push completion (`HTTP 200 OK`), the sync engine unconditionally set `file.isDirty = false`, wiping newer local modifications typed while the HTTP request was in flight (`LUGX-010`).
  - `coalesceOperation` merged incoming edits into any non-synced operation, including `syncing` (triggering network race conditions) or `conflict`, `failed`, and `dead_letter` (trapping fresh user edits in terminal error states) (`LUGX-040`).
  - Server push completion ignored server `version`, causing subsequent edits to fail with false HTTP 412 conflicts resolved by dropping edits (`LUGX-011`).
  - Network push failure handlers executed `rollback.rollback`, destructively restoring pre-push snapshots over fresh offline edits (`LUGX-013`).
- **Resolution:**
  - Introduced monotonic `localRevision` counter in `IDBFile`, incremented on every `saveLocal` mutation.
  - Implemented Lean CAS (Compare-And-Swap) gating in `commitFileAndOperationSync` and `markFileClean` comparing `sentRevision` vs `localRevision`: if `localRevision > sentRevision`, updates `etag`/`version` in `baseSnapshot` but strictly retains `isDirty: true`, ensuring newer in-flight edits are preserved and pushed on the next pass.
  - Extracted pure `src/lib/sync/coalescing.ts` module with `canCoalesce` restricting merges strictly to `status === 'queued'`, advancing `localRevision` and resetting retry counters.
  - Passed authoritative server `version` to atomic CAS commits to keep client aligned with server state.
  - Excised destructive rollback from network push failure catches; checkpoints are cleanly discarded via `removeCheckpoint()`, preserving offline edits for backoff retries.
  - Verified via dedicated test suite `src/test/sync/sync-cas-concurrency.test.ts` (9/9 passing) with 100% pass rate across all test suites.

## TD-15 — Latent Upstream AST Recursion DoS in Dev Linter Toolchain (`braces` <= 3.0.3) — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-10-26)

- **Debt:** Security advisory `GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm` / `CVE-2026-93687` flags an uncontrolled recursion stack-exhaustion denial-of-service vulnerability (`CWE-674`) in `braces <= 3.0.3`. The library was a transitive dependency of `eslint-config-next@16.3.8` via `@next/eslint-plugin-next@16.3.8` -> `fast-glob@3.3.1` -> `micromatch@4.0.8`.
- **Resolution (2026-10-26):**
  - Following the upgrade of `eslint-config-next@16.4.0`, the transitive dependency chain resolved cleanly to safe upstream packages with zero vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit`.
  - In accordance with the defined Conditions to Revisit / Reverse, `GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm` was permanently purged from `ALLOWLIST` in `scripts/ci-audit.mjs`.
  - `npm run audit:ci` executes with a completely empty allowlist (`ALLOWLIST = new Map()`) and validates 0 vulnerabilities across both production and development dependencies (100% clean gate).

## TD-16 — Monolithic `sync-manager.ts` Architecture & Single-File Complexity — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 16 / 2026-10-04)

- **Debt:** `src/lib/sync/sync-manager.ts` had expanded to 1,952 lines of code, conflating multiple distinct operational domains: queue consumption & exponential backoff scheduling, dirty file push batches & concurrency locking, remote cursor pull & pagination, and in-memory encrypted conflict quarantine with Diff3 auto-resolution. This excessive size hindered maintainability, modular testability, and adherence to clean single-responsibility boundaries.
- **Resolution:**
  - Decomposed `sync-manager.ts` into a Lean Coordinator pattern (< 350 lines, specifically 341 lines).
  - Extracted `SyncQueueWorker` (`src/lib/sync/sync-queue-worker.ts`, 766 lines) for operations queue execution, retry backoff with jitter, dirty file pushing, and non-destructive checkpoint cleanup (LUGX-013).
  - Extracted `SyncEncryptedConflictStore` (`src/lib/sync/sync-encrypted-conflict-store.ts`, 447 lines) for in-memory `CONFLICT_LOCKED` quarantine, bounded FIFO capacity (100), diagnostics, and Diff3 unlock auto-resolution.
  - Extracted `SyncPullEngine` (`src/lib/sync/sync-pull-engine.ts`, 537 lines) for incremental cursor pagination, remote updates, pullFile conflict handling, and tombstone reconciliation.
  - Centralized shared domain contracts and types into `src/lib/sync/sync-manager.types.ts` ensuring clean dependency graphs with zero circular imports.
  - Reused existing `SyncRollback` (`src/lib/sync/rollback.ts`, 303 lines) directly via dependency injection without duplicating rollback logic.
  - Re-exported all extracted classes and contracts through `src/lib/sync/index.ts` maintaining 100% backward compatibility for all public consumers and test suites.
  - Verified across 100% of sync unit test suites (306/306 vitest tests passing).

## TD-17 — Editor Orchestrator Monolithic Autosave, React 19 Ref Violations & Vault Security Gaps — ✅ RESOLVED (Phase 17 / 2026-10-04)

- **Debt:**
  - `useEditorOrchestrator` combined document state, conflict handling, and monolithic autosave debounce timers into a single file exceeding 1,900 lines (`LUGX-020`).
  - Render-time mutation of mutable ref containers in `useAIStream` and `useEditorOrchestrator` violated React 19 concurrent render purity standards.
  - On component unmount, `flushOnUnmount` persisted plaintext into IndexedDB tagged as encrypted if the vault was locked (`LUGX-004`).
  - In `loadInitialFile`, early exits on vault locked state or decryption errors executed the enclosing `finally` block, falsely resetting hydration to `"ready"` and unlocking the editor (`LUGX-047`).
  - Decryption errors during initial file hydration rendered raw ciphertext or broken strings into the CodeMirror surface (`LUGX-048`).
  - In `SearchReplace`, replacement operated blindly on cached character ranges without verifying that the live document slice matched the expected search query (`LUGX-054`).
  - File encryption/decryption toggle in `FileContextMenu` lacked optimistic concurrency controls, risking overwrites of concurrent edits (`LUGX-055`).
  - Legacy ad-hoc file AAD generation accepted null, undefined, or empty `userId` and `fileId`, risking corrupted or mismatched cryptographic authentication tags (`LUGX-056`).
  - When importing files to the vault offline-first, failures to reach the server left the local copy unpersisted or incorrectly marked clean (`LUGX-057`).
- **Resolution:**
  - **LUGX-020 (Autosave Hook Extraction):** Extracted `useEditorAutosave` (`src/hooks/use-editor-autosave.ts`, 178 lines) with pure injected callbacks (`persist`, `flushOnUnmount`, `getContent`, `isBlocked`, `onUserEdit`), debounce coalescing, and automatic suspension while `isWriteLocked` is active with seamless resumption upon unlock.
  - **React 19 Ref Discipline:** Wrapped all closure-synchronizing ref mutations in `useLayoutEffect` across `use-editor-autosave.ts`, `use-editor-orchestrator.ts`, and `use-ai-stream.ts`, guaranteeing zero render-phase ref access.
  - **LUGX-004 (Fail-Closed Unmount Flush):** Enforced fail-closed vault checks in `flushOnUnmount`: skips persistence if vault is locked (`!sessionKeyStore.hasMasterKey()`), and re-encrypts outbound content via `SyncCryptoGateway.encryptOutbound` if unlocked before writing to IndexedDB.
  - **LUGX-047 (Finally Block Guard):** Introduced `isVaultLockedExit` and `isFatalExit` flags in `loadInitialFile` guarding the `finally` block against resetting `hydration` to `"ready"`.
  - **LUGX-048 (Fatal Hydration on Decrypt Failure):** Decryption errors immediately transition hydration to `"fatal"`, freeze the editor (`adapter.setEditable(false)`), and surface an explicit error banner without exposing ciphertext.
  - **LUGX-054 (Stale Range Verification):** Verified `currentDoc.slice(from, to) === searchText` synchronously before executing single or multi-range replacements, aborting and re-indexing if the document changed.
  - **LUGX-055 (OCC Encryption Preconditions):** Passed `expectedVersion` and `expectedETag` to `toggleFileEncryption`, detecting and surfacing HTTP 412 conflicts gracefully.
  - **LUGX-056 (Strict AAD Validation & Standardization):** Enforced non-empty trimmed string validation throwing informative errors on invalid IDs. In Phase 1, legacy ad-hoc `buildFileAAD` was formally superseded and pruned in favor of the canonical centralized factory `@/lib/crypto/aad` via `AAD.file(userId, fileId)` emitting format `lugx:v1:file:${userId}:${fileId}`.
  - **LUGX-057 (Offline-First Vault Import Durability):** Pre-persisted imported vault files to IndexedDB with `isDirty: true` and `lastSyncedAt: 0` before server dispatch, marking clean only after server confirmation.
  - **Verification:** Covered by 5 dedicated regression test suites: `use-editor-autosave.test.ts`, `editor-security-hardening.test.ts`, `search-replace.stale-ranges.test.tsx`, `file-context-menu.encryption-conflict.test.tsx`, and `sidebar-import.vault.test.tsx`.

## TD-18 — Editor Orchestrator Monolithic Conflict & Cross-Tab Extraction, Ambient Channel Parity Debt — ✅ RESOLVED / ACCEPTED DEBT (Phase 18 / 2026-10-13)

- **Debt:**
  - `useEditorOrchestrator` conflated document state management, AI streaming, initial hydration, and monolithic conflict handling (`handle412Conflict`, `handleResolveConflict`, `handleSyncConflict`, `handleRemoteUpdate`) alongside cross-tab event listeners into a single file exceeding 1,936 lines.
  - Sibling components across the application (`VaultUnlockModal`, `FileContextMenu`, `SessionKeyStore`) broadcast cross-tab events on an ambient channel (`textai_cross_tab_sync`), whereas Phase 15 introduced a user-scoped channel pattern (`lugx_sync_${userId}`). Attempting isolated user scoping inside the editor conflict hook without updating all modals, context menus, and worker bridges caused dropped vault lock and unlock synchronization across browser tabs.
- **Resolution (Orchestrator Conflict Extraction):**
  - **Hook Extraction (`useEditorConflict`):** Extracted `useEditorConflict` (`src/hooks/use-editor-conflict.ts`, 996 lines) with pure callback and getter injection (`UseEditorConflictOptions`), isolating 412 conflict handling, inbound decryption, three-way resolution submission, and cross-tab event lifecycle synchronization.
  - **Orchestrator Reduction:** Reduced `src/hooks/use-editor-orchestrator.ts` from 1,936 lines to 1,327 lines (1,211 active executable lines), strictly delegating conflict states (`activeConflict`, `isConflictDialogOpen`, `isResolvingConflict`, `isBlockedByConflict`) and event dispatching to the standalone hook.
  - **LUGX-010 (In-Flight Snapshot Detection):** `useEditorConflict` captures `startSnapshot` before initiating async network resolution calls and verifies `normalizeMarkdownSource(liveNow) === normalizeMarkdownSource(startSnapshot)` post-flight. Concurrent user edits typed during flight are preserved in CodeMirror (LUGX-013) and flagged dirty (`markDirty()`) for subsequent autosave.
  - **LUGX-020 (Synchronous Dirty Read on `file_saved`):** Cross-tab `file_saved` reads synchronous getters (`isDirty()`, local IDB, active conflict) rather than asynchronous React state: clean tabs adopt server version/content atomically, while dirty tabs retain local version anchors for optimistic locking.
  - **LUGX-049 (Pre-Lock IDB Flush on `vault_locked`):** When receiving cross-tab `vault_locked` while dirty, content is flushed to IndexedDB before cancelling autosave and purging volatile RAM keys (fail-closed if Master Key is absent, LUGX-004).
  - **LUGX-051 (Preserve Dirty Edits on Cross-Tab Toggle):** Cross-tab `file_encrypted` and `file_decrypted` toggle handlers preserve dirty edits without invoking `markClean()`.
  - **LUGX-053 (`normalizeMarkdownSource` Consistency):** Unified all Markdown equality and false-conflict checks through `normalizeMarkdownSource`.
  - **Verification:** Covered by new dedicated unit contract suite `src/test/editor/use-editor-conflict.test.ts` (11/11 tests passing).
- **Accepted Debt (Ambient Broadcast Parity Across Vault Modals):**
  - **Decision Owner:** Project Owner & Systems Analyst.
  - **Decision Rationale:** To maintain 100% interoperability with existing UI modals (`VaultUnlockModal`, `TrustDeviceModal`, `FileContextMenu`), `useEditorConflict` broadcasts and subscribes on the ambient `textai_cross_tab_sync` channel via `broadcastCrossTabEvent` and `subscribeCrossTabSync`. Prematurely enforcing isolated user scoping in the editor hook alone created a split-brain architecture where vault lock/unlock events broadcast by ambient modals were silently ignored by the editor.
  - **Mitigation Currently in Place:** `useEditorConflict` binds to the shared `subscribeCrossTabSync` listener and filters events by fileId and tabId (`senderTabId !== currentTabId`). Encryption operations strictly validate standardized user AAD bindings constructed via `AAD.file(userId, fileId)` (`lugx:v1:file:${userId}:${fileId}`) in volatile RAM, preventing cross-tenant data corruption.
  - **Conditions to Revisit / Reverse:** A systematic multi-tenant overhaul milestone that simultaneously refactors all UI modals, context menus, and worker bridges to subscribe to user-scoped `lugx_sync_${userId}` channels.

## TD-19 — Multi-Tab Cross-Broadcast Race, 4-Line Visual Diff Duplication & Silent 412 Auto-Merge — ✅ RESOLVED (Release 1.46.1 / 2026-10-13)

- **Debt:**
  - Sibling tabs reading stale state from IndexedDB due to out-of-order broadcast before write settlement (`broadcastCrossTabEvent` invoked prior to `await saveLocal()`).
  - Visual Diff LCS gap processor treating in-place line replacements as local deletions (`baseSet.has(line)` evaluated across all insertions), creating phantom duplicate strike-throughs on line 4 and empty deletions in remote view.
  - Diff3 Deletion Guard pruning remote lines when local lines were mutated in place without line count reduction (`aContent.length < oContent.length` guard absent).
  - Manual conflict modal disruption on HTTP 412 when edits are clean and non-overlapping.
- **Resolution:**
  - **Storage-First Sequential Broadcast:** Enforced `await syncHook.saveLocal()` settlement before dispatching `broadcastCrossTabEvent('file_saved')`.
  - **Paired Visual Diff & Deletion Guard Hardening:** In `conflict-resolver.ts`, `baseSet.has(line)` is restricted to surplus insertions (`insLines.length > delLines.length`). In `diff3.ts`, Deletion Guard only prunes when `aContent.length < oContent.length`.
  - **Silent Automated 3-Way Merge (`LUGX-054`):** Integrated `attemptThreeWayMerge` into `handle412Conflict`. If `status === 'merged_clean'`, commits to IDB, pushes to server, updates editor buffer, and skips `ConflictDialog`.
  - **React 19 Lint Cleanliness:** Eliminated render-phase state resets and missing mounted guards across `create-vault-modal`, `trust-device-modal`, `vault-security-card`, `vault-unlock-modal`, `ocr-settings-card`, and `editor/[fileId]/page.tsx`.
  - **Verification:** Covered by dedicated unit suites `src/test/editor/use-editor-conflict.test.ts` (12/12 passing) and `src/test/sync/sync-conflict-resolver.test.ts` (61/61 passing).

## TD-20 — Cloud Provider Smoke Test Bypass & Google Gemini API Overload Debt — ACCEPTED DEBT (2026-10-26)

- **Debt:**
  - In Stage 7 of the CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), execution of the live cloud provider smoke test suite (`src/test/ai/ai-live-e2e.live.test.ts`) is temporarily bypassed with `TEST_EXIT_CODE=0` and a warning notice.
  - Upstream Google Gemini API (Free Tier) persistently returns `503 Service Unavailable (High Demand)` and `429 Too Many Requests` overloads across configured API keys in the CI environment, triggering test timeouts (>60s) and intermittent flakiness on GitHub Actions runners.
  - The internal client fallback hierarchy across multiple models (`gemini-3.8-flash`, `3.6-flash`, `3.5-flash-lite`, `3.1-flash-lite`) requires a comprehensive architectural overhaul to prevent tight-loop retries on exhausted fallback chains and avoid tripping circuit breakers prematurely.
- **Accepted Debt (Stage 7 Smoke Bypass):**
  - **Decision Owner:** Project Owner & Systems Architect.
  - **Decision Rationale:** To unblock the core CI pipeline and allow feature development to proceed unhindered by external provider instability. Stages 1 through 6 (Lint, Typecheck, Build, 89 In-Memory Unit Suites, 21 Isolated Database Live Suites, and 14 Browser Playwright E2E Specs) remain 100% active and rigorously enforced with fail-closed security gates.
  - **Mitigation Currently in Place:**
    - Mandatory cloud secrets (`TEST_DATABASE_URL` and `GEMINI_KEY_1`) verification remains enforced in Stage 7 with strict `exit 1` fail-closed gating on protected branches.
    - All business logic, reservation lifecycles, and credit settlement reducers remain covered by in-memory unit and contract tests with 100% passing rate.
  - **Conditions to Revisit / Reverse:**
    1. Provisioning a dedicated, stable paid-tier Google Gemini API key or enterprise quota.
    2. Completing the planned architectural overhaul of the AI client layer (e.g. migration to Vercel AI SDK with multi-provider failover).
    3. Re-enabling the live execution of `src/test/ai/ai-live-e2e.live.test.ts` inside Stage 7 of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
