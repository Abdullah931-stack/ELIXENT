# Security Architecture & Rate Limiting

This document covers the cross-cutting security layers of the LUGX platform:
request authentication, rate limiting, content sanitization, local data
encryption, and the protected maintenance cron. Everything here is derived from
the current source files referenced inline.

---

## 1. Request Authentication (`src/proxy.ts`)

The Next.js 16 Edge proxy runs on every route except static assets (see its
`config.matcher`). Behavior:

| Concern | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Protected pages | `/workspace`, `/account`, `/dashboard` require a Supabase session (`supabase.auth.getUser()`); unauthenticated page navigations redirect to `/login?redirectTo=…` (preserving search params / deep links) |
| Fast-Path Routing (TD-12) | Public routes (`/` homepage, static assets) and `/login` requests without auth cookies completely bypass `supabase.auth.getUser()`, eliminating unnecessary network round-trips and socket contention |
| Watchdog Timeout (TD-12) | `supabase.auth.getUser()` is encapsulated inside a 2500ms timeout watchdog (`AbortSignal.timeout(2500)`). If Supabase auth stalls or hangs, the call safely aborts to `null` user, preventing Chromium socket pool saturation (`CLOSE_WAIT` exhaustion) |
| Cookie Preservation (TD-12) | Redirect responses (307) and API 401 JSON responses preserve all `Set-Cookie` headers via `copyCookiesAndRedirect`, ensuring cookie deletion and session rotation directives reach the browser |
| Server Actions & API routes | Under protected paths, an unauthenticated request receives a **JSON `401 Unauthorized`** instead of an HTML redirect (an HTML redirect breaks the Server Action client runtime) |
| Logged-in access control | Authenticated users hitting `/login` are redirected to `/dashboard` |
| OAuth code interception (LUGX-140) | Any request carrying an OAuth `code` query param strictly targeting root (`/`) or login (`/login`) is redirected to `/auth/callback`, preventing parameter interception on arbitrary application sub-paths |
| Session refresh & Sign-Out | The proxy refreshes the Supabase session cookie on matched requests. When signing out (`signOut()` in `src/server/actions/auth-actions.ts`), `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` purges client router cache and all `sb-*` auth cookies are proactively cleared |

### 1.1. Open Redirect & Host Header Injection Hardening (`src/lib/auth/safe-redirect.ts`)

All redirect parameters entering the authentication pipeline are strictly validated by `resolveSafeRedirectPath(target, defaultPath)`:
- **MAX_URL_LENGTH = 2048**: Enforces upfront bounds to prevent ReDoS/CPU exhaustion.
- **Universal Backslash Rejection**: Rejects any occurrence of `\` in the target or decoded representation.
- **Unicode Normalization (`NFKC`)**: Rejects homographs (full-width solidus `／`, reverse solidus `＼`, small solidus `﹨`) and zero-width characters (`\u200B-\u200D`, `\uFEFF`).
- **Control Character & Null-Byte Stripping**: Strips ASCII `0x00-0x1F`, `0x7F`, and blocks null-byte/CRLF injection.
- **Iterative 3-Pass Decoding**: Prevents multi-encoded bypasses (`/%2F%2Fevil.com`).
- **Scheme & Protocol Rejection**: Rejects `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, `blob:`, `file:`, `about:`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, `sms:`, `urn:`, and external protocols `http:`, `https:`.
- **OAuth Callback (`/auth/callback`)**: Redirection targets are anchored exclusively to trusted origins (`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || origin`), completely ignoring spoofable `x-forwarded-host` headers.

### 1.2. Cross-User Resource Isolation & Anti-Enumeration (404 vs 403)

To prevent resource enumeration (probing for valid UUIDs via 403 vs 404 responses), all lookups across `src/server/auth/session.ts` (`requireOwnedFile`), `file-ops.ts`, `import-file.ts`, and `stream/route.ts` return unified `404 Not Found` responses when foreign/unauthorized resources are accessed. Furthermore, `requireOwnedFile` performs upfront UUID regex syntax verification, preventing PostgreSQL `22P02` syntax errors from revealing invalid UUID queries.

### 1.3 Zero-Knowledge Encrypted Content Governance & AI Route Hardening (LUGX-085, LUGX-004, LUGX-017)

To prevent unintentional data leakage or uninspected transmission of client-side encrypted vault files, the platform enforces strict server-side and UI governance barriers:

1. **Mandatory `fileId` on AI Streaming (`/api/ai/stream` / LUGX-085):**
   - Every AI request must specify a valid, non-empty `fileId` string.
   - If `fileId` is missing or invalid, the route immediately fails closed with HTTP `400 Bad Request` and error code `MISSING_FILE_ID`.
   - The route verifies document existence and user ownership against PostgreSQL (`schema.files`).
   - If `targetFile.isEncrypted = true`, the route checks `userVaultProfiles.allowAIOnEncryptedFiles`. If not explicitly enabled by the user, the stream is rejected with HTTP `403 Forbidden` (`AI_PROHIBITED_ON_ENCRYPTED_FILES`) with zero quota consumed and zero prompt data transmitted to Gemini.
   - Quota reservation (`reserveAndUpdateUsage`) is strictly coupled to the validated non-null `fileId`.

2. **Governed Document Export & Plaintext Warning Modal (`ExportWarningModal` / `export-service.ts` / LUGX-004, LUGX-017):**
   - When exporting documents from the editor (`handleExport`), encrypted files trigger an interactive security modal (`ExportWarningModal`) before any unencrypted payload can be written to disk.
   - The library layer (`src/lib/export/export-service.ts`) enforces defense-in-depth: calling `exportDocument` with `isEncrypted = true` and `confirmedPlaintextExport = false` immediately returns `{ success: false, errorCode: 'ENCRYPTED_EXPORT_UNCONFIRMED' }`.
   - Plaintext download executes only after explicit user confirmation in the dialog.

Defense-in-depth note: proxy gating complements — never replaces — the
per-route `getUser()` checks performed inside every API route and server action
(see [`file-ownership-and-versioning.md`](../sync/file-ownership-and-versioning.md) and [`../../records/closures/phase-11-to-15-core-infrastructure/phase-12-auth-ownership-closure.md`](../../records/closures/phase-11-to-15-core-infrastructure/phase-12-auth-ownership-closure.md)).

---

## 2. Rate Limiting (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`)

A per-user **sliding-window counter** backed by Upstash Redis with explicit per-tier failure modes (hardened in Phase 13 / LUGX-079). Configuration:

```ts
export const RATE_LIMITS = {
    SYNC_API:  { limit: 100, windowSeconds: 15 * 60, failureMode: 'fail-open' as const },
    FILE_API:  { limit: 200, windowSeconds: 15 * 60, failureMode: 'fail-open' as const },
    GENERAL:   { limit: 300, windowSeconds: 15 * 60, failureMode: 'fail-open' as const },
    AUTH:      { limit: 20,  windowSeconds: 15 * 60, failureMode: 'fail-closed' as const },
    AI_STREAM: { limit: 30,  windowSeconds: 60,      failureMode: 'fail-closed' as const },
} as const;
```

Exported limiter instances and their consumers:

| Instance | Key prefix | Failure Policy | Used by |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `syncApiRateLimiter` | `sync` | `fail-open` | `GET /api/files/sync` |
| `fileApiRateLimiter` | `file` | `fail-open` | `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE /api/files/[id]` |
| `authRateLimiter` | `auth` | `fail-closed` | authentication endpoints |
| `aiStreamRateLimiter` | `ai-stream` | `fail-closed` | `POST /api/ai/stream` |

### 2.1 Dual-Mode Failure Architecture (Fail-Open vs. Fail-Closed)

The platform enforces explicit, deterministic failure policies per service tier:

1. **Fail-Closed (AI Streaming & Authentication Endpoints / LUGX-079):**
   - Implemented in `RateLimiter.limit()` for `ai-stream` and `auth`.
   - If Upstash Redis is unreachable, errors, or unconfigured, the limiter immediately rejects the request returning `{ success: false, isDegraded: true }`.
   - The route handler emits **HTTP 503 Service Unavailable** with a `Retry-After: 10` header and body `{ error: "Service Unavailable", message: "Rate limiting service is temporarily unavailable. Request blocked under fail-closed security policy." }`.
   - **Rationale:** Protects upstream LLM provider quotas and keys from rapid bursts during Redis outages, and prevents brute-force credential stuffing attacks against authentication endpoints.
2. **Fail-Open (General Application & Sync Endpoints):**
   - Implemented in `RateLimiter.limit()` for `sync`, `file`, and `general`.
   - If Upstash Redis is unreachable or returns an error, the limiter logs a warning and returns `{ success: true, isDegraded: true }`.
   - **Rationale:** Protects offline-first architecture; temporary infrastructure issues on Redis never lock legitimate users out of reading, editing, or synchronizing local documents.
3. **Conditional Token Consumption (LUGX-079):**
   - The limiter executes a 2-phase pipeline: Phase 1 evaluates `zremrangebyscore` and `zcard`. Phase 2 executes `zadd` strictly if `currentCount < limit`.
   - Rejected requests never append members to the sorted set, completely eliminating the client retry lock trap.
4. **Database-Enforced ACID User Quotas & Credit Ledger:**
   - User consumption and credit balances are tracked and enforced in PostgreSQL via `users.credit_balance_micro` (with a non-negative check constraint `users_credit_balance_non_negative`) and `credit_ledger_transactions` (migration `0013_migrate_to_credit_ledger.sql`), replacing the legacy `usage` and `ai_reservations` tables.
5. **Hybrid Fail-Open Distributed Lock (Stripe Webhook Concurrency / Phase 21):**
   - Implemented in `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` via in-flight Redis lock `stripe:lock:${eventId}` (`nx: true, ex: 30`) bounded by a 1500ms watchdog (`withTimeout`).
   - If Redis is unreachable or times out, the lock fails open to PostgreSQL ACID transactions (`executeSubscriptionTransition`) and database-level idempotency (`subscription_events`).
   - Authoritative specification: [`docs/guides/billing/stripe-integration.md`](../../guides/billing/stripe-integration.md).

Response contract:

- Success responses carry `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`,
  `X-RateLimit-Reset` (set by `addRateLimitHeaders()`), and `X-Correlation-ID`.
- Normal exhaustion returns **429 Too Many Requests** from `rateLimitExceededResponse()` with a `Retry-After` header.
- Fail-closed outage rejection returns **503 Service Unavailable** with `X-RateLimit-Degraded: 1` and `Retry-After: 10`.

## 3. Content Safety & Markdown Normalization

Documents in LUGX are stored and processed exclusively as pure UTF-8 Markdown text (`MarkdownSource`). Content integrity and safety are enforced through strict Unicode normalization and client-safe rendering avoiding HTML injection vectors.

### 3.1 Markdown Source Normalization (`src/lib/sync/etag-generator.ts`)
- **Universal Normalization (`normalizeMarkdownSource`)**: Canonical normalization converting `\r\n` and `\r` to LF (`\n`), applying Unicode NFC normalization, and stripping null bytes (`\0`) to guarantee PostgreSQL text encoding safety and deterministic cross-platform ETag generation.

### 3.2 Pure Markdown Content Security & Elimination of HTML Injection Vectors
- **Zero HTML Storage Invariant**: The storage layer (PostgreSQL and IndexedDB) persists pure Markdown text without HTML wrapping or translation.
- **Client-Safe Native Rendering**: The CodeMirror 6 editor and streaming preview surfaces operate directly on Markdown strings and AST token decorations, completely eliminating `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and legacy HTML sanitizers (`sanitize.server.ts`, `sanitize-client.ts`, `dompurify`).

### 3.3 Ingestion Security, Magic Bytes & Traversal Defense (`src/lib/parsers/file-validator.ts`, `src/server/actions/import-file.ts`)
- **Disguised Binary Inspection (`isDisguisedBinary`)**: Inspects byte streams for known executable and compressed archive magic bytes (Windows PE `MZ` with binary DOS header markers, Linux ELF `\x7fELF`, macOS Mach-O, ZIP `PK\x03\x04`, 7-Zip, and RAR). Files with disguised executable payloads attempting to bypass extension restrictions are rejected in $O(1)$ time prior to full-string processing. Genuine text documents starting with acronyms like "MZ" are safely exempted via binary header discrimination.
- **Filename Path Traversal Sanitization (`sanitizeFilename`)**: Filenames undergo rigorous sanitization stripping directory traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`), reserved OS characters (`<>:"/\\|?*`), and control characters (`\x00-\x1F\x7F`). Sibling file title collisions are resolved via single-query in-memory deduplication with a loop circuit breaker (`counter <= 100`) and a safe 480-character base title boundary.
- **PostgreSQL Null-Byte Elimination**: Pre-cleans incoming strings by eliminating all `\0` bytes, preventing raw PostgreSQL query truncation or encoding crashes.
- **GFM Table Line Integrity (`pdf-table-extractor.ts`)**: Replaces embedded carriage returns and line breaks (`[\r\n]+`) in table cell items with spaces, preventing multi-line cells from terminating table rows prematurely and preserving strict GitHub-Flavored Markdown syntax.

## 4. Dual-Tier Hybrid Encryption & Isolated Crypto Worker (`src/lib/sync/encryption.ts`, `src/lib/workers/crypto.worker.ts`)

LUGX implements a zero-knowledge dual-tier hybrid encryption architecture offloaded to a dedicated Web Worker to ensure zero main-thread UI lag and complete defense-in-depth:

### 4.1 Isolated Cryptographic Execution & Non-Extractable Keys
- **Background Worker Offloading (`src/lib/workers/crypto.worker.ts`)**: All computationally intensive key derivations (PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations) and symmetric transformations run in an isolated Web Worker via a typed RPC bridge (`src/lib/sync/crypto-worker-bridge.ts`), sustaining 60fps UI performance.
- **Zero-Latency Direct CSPRNG & W3C Chunking (`src/lib/sync/crypto-utils.ts`)**: Cryptographically secure random byte generation (IVs, salts, entropy) executes synchronously via `globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues` (<0.001ms), eliminating Web Worker IPC overhead and preventing background tab throttling deadlocks. Requests exceeding 64KB are automatically chunked to strictly comply with W3C quota limits (`MAX_RANDOM_BYTES_CHUNK = 65536`).
- **Resilient Fallback & Circuit Breaker Queue Drain (`src/lib/sync/crypto-worker-bridge.ts`)**: In the event of Web Worker suspension or unexpected failure (e.g. background tab hibernation or Turbopack worker compilation stall), tasks time out at 5 seconds, trip the circuit breaker (`isTerminated = true`), and immediately drain all queued requests directly into the in-process `SubtleCrypto` engine without hanging the user interface or losing offline persistence.
- **Direct Engine Dual Mode**: In Node.js/SSR and automated test environments, the bridge transparently executes against the direct WebCrypto SubtleCrypto engine with identical security invariants and zero artificial mocking.
- **Non-Extractable CryptoKey Enforcement**: All derived and imported keys are marked `extractable: false` within Web Crypto API memory spaces.

### 4.2 Multi-Layer Defensive RAM Sanitization
- **Instant `.fill(0)` Memory Clearing**: Intermediate byte arrays (`Uint8Array`) containing passwords, salts, CSPRNG initialization vectors (IVs), 128-bit entropy buffers, and decrypted plaintexts are zeroed out via `.fill(0)` inside `finally` blocks immediately upon operation completion.

### 4.3 Zero-Knowledge Envelope & Standardized AAD Context Binding (`src/lib/crypto/aad.ts`, `src/lib/sync/encryption.ts`)
- **Algorithm & Envelope (`EncryptedEnvelope`)**:
  - Algorithm: **AES-GCM 256-bit** with CSPRNG 12-byte IV and 16-byte salt.
  - Key Derivation: **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** with **600,000 iterations**.
  - Envelope Schema: `{ version: 1, algorithm: 'AES-GCM-256', keyId, iv, salt, ciphertext, kdfIterations }`.
- **Standardized AAD Hierarchy (`lugx:v1:<domain>:<userId>[:<resourceId>]`)**:
  - Documents: `AAD.file(userId, fileId)` -> `lugx:v1:file:${userId}:${fileId}` (with fallback to legacy `vault:file:...`).
  - Password Wrap: `AAD.passwordWrap(userId)` -> `lugx:v1:pass:${userId}` (with fallback to legacy `vault:pass:...` and `master_key:...`).
  - Recovery Seed Wrap: `AAD.recoveryWrap(userId)` -> `lugx:v1:recovery:${userId}` (with fallback to legacy `vault:seed:...` and `recovery_master_key:...`).
  - Device Trust: `AAD.deviceWrap(userId, epoch)` -> `lugx:v1:device:${userId}:${epoch}`.
  - Validation: `isCanonicalAAD(aad)` validates schema adherence. Decryption with tampered or mismatched AAD throws `InvalidCiphertextOrKeyError`.

### 4.4 Standard BIP-39 Wordlist, Adaptive Dual-Try Recovery & Subkeys (`src/lib/crypto/*`, `src/lib/vault/*`)
- **Canonical BIP-0039 Wordlist (`src/lib/crypto/bip39-wordlist.ts`)**:
  - Strictly adheres to the 2,048 English wordlist defined in Bitcoin BIP-0039 (remediating LUGX-043).
  - Purged 4 non-standard corrupted words (`coal`, `paci`, `squad`, `squash`) and restored 4 missing canonical entries (`pact`, `paddle`, `squeeze`, `tragic`).
  - Word index lookup validated via `BIP39_STANDARD_WORD_MAP` in $O(1)$ time.
- **Adaptive Dual-Try Recovery Migration (`src/lib/vault/recovery.ts` / LUGX-005)**:
  - Resolves historical AAD mismatch between vault creation (`vault:seed:`) and unlock (`vault:recovery:`).
  - **Try 1 (Canonical)**: Attempts unwrapping with `lugx:v1:recovery:${userId}`.
  - **Try 2 (Legacy Fallback)**: On MAC failure, falls back to legacy `vault:seed:${userId}`.
  - **Transparent Upgrading**: Upon legacy unwrap success, the Master Key is immediately re-wrapped under `lugx:v1:recovery:${userId}` with a fresh CSPRNG IV and persisted to IndexedDB and cloud PostgreSQL (`updateVaultRecoveryEnvelope`).
- **Unicode Normalization & Fast HKDF Subkeys (`src/lib/crypto/key-derivation.ts`)**:
  - Unicode Normalization Form KC (`normalizePassword(NFKC)`): Normalizes user passwords prior to PBKDF2 key derivation, eliminating cross-platform character decomposition bugs (remediating LUGX-133).
  - HKDF-SHA-256 Subkey Derivation: Derives subkeys for documents (`deriveDocumentKey`), search indices (`deriveSearchIndexKey`), and proof of possession (`deriveProofOfPossession`) without repeating CPU-heavy PBKDF2 operations.

    end
```

### 4.5 In-Memory Session Key Store, Monotonic Epoch & Auto-Lock (`src/lib/sync/session-key-store.ts`, `src/lib/vault/vault-manager.ts`)

- **Strict Zero-Trace General Default**: The Master Key is stored strictly in volatile RAM Heap memory (`Uint8Array`) and is never written in plaintext to `sessionStorage` or local disk.
- **Detached Caller Buffer Isolation (LUGX-016)**: `getMasterKeyRaw()` returns an isolated clone (`new Uint8Array(this.masterKeyRaw)`), preventing caller modifications or local wipes (`wipeBuffer`) from zeroing the active key held within `SessionKeyStore`.
- **Monotonic Lock Epoch & Concurrency Protection (LUGX-016)**: `lockEpoch` increments monotonically on every lock/purge. `withMasterKey<T>()` verifies that the active epoch has not changed during asynchronous operations, safely aborting if the vault locked concurrently to prevent zero-key encryption.
- **Deterministic Auto-Lock & Inactivity Decoupling (LUGX-042)**: Enforces a strict 1-hour inactivity window (3,600,000 ms). Programmatic key retrieval (`getMasterKey()`, `getMasterKeyRaw()`) does not postpone auto-lock; only explicit user interface interactions (`touch()`, `VaultManager.touchActivity()`) update the activity timestamp.
- **Caller Memory Sanitization & Buffer Independence**: UI modals (`CreateVaultModal`, `VaultUnlockModal`, `TrustDeviceModal`) proactively wipe temporary unwrapped/generated key buffers in `finally` blocks via `wipeBuffer()`, while `SessionKeyStore` maintains an isolated copy immune to caller zeroing.

### 4.6 Transparent At-Rest Encrypted IndexedDB (`src/lib/sync/indexeddb.ts`)

- **Always-On Local Encryption**: Transparently encrypts all sensitive client-side records (`IDBFile.content`, `baseSnapshot.content`, `IDBOperation.content`, `previousContent`, and operational snapshots) using AES-GCM-256 via user-scoped `LocalDeviceKey`.
- **Instance-Scoped Key Lifecycle & Volatile RAM Sanitization**: `LocalDeviceKey` is scoped to each `IndexedDBManager` instance to prevent cross-user key contamination in multi-account scenarios. Keys are securely zeroed via `wipeBuffer` on `close()` and `clearAll()`, and purged from RAM via `sessionKeyStore.purgeKeys()` on user logout or session termination in `useSync`.
- **Resilient Lazy Key Persistence**: Keys are retrieved or lazily created through `await this.getDB()` to guarantee that the underlying `sync_metadata` store is open before key persistence, preventing silent key-loss across reloads.
- **Cold-Start Concurrency Guard**: Uses an in-flight singleton promise (`keyInitPromise`) to deduplicate simultaneous cold-start operations on fresh databases, ensuring identical cryptographic key derivation without heavy lock mechanisms.
- **Zero Plaintext At-Rest Invariant**: Confirmed by raw low-level database inspection; no readable document content or operation diffs are ever written to the client disk in plaintext.
- **Cryptographic AAD Binding**: Binds unique domain contexts to each cipher record (`idb:file:${id}`, `idb:snapshot:${id}`, `idb:op:${opId}`) preventing payload tampering or cross-file substitution attacks.
- **Fault Resilience & Isolation (`CorruptedLocalRecordError`)**: Automatically isolates damaged or authentication-mismatched records without crashing bulk queries (`getAllFiles`, `getDirtyFiles`).
- **Seamless Legacy Migration**: In-place fallback that transparently reads legacy unencrypted records and upgrades them to ciphertext on subsequent writes.
- **Offline Profile & Device Trust Storage**: Manages cached cloud vault profiles (`saveCachedVaultProfile`) and PIN-wrapped envelopes (`saveDeviceTrustEnvelope`, `getDeviceTrustEnvelope`, `clearDeviceTrustEnvelope`) in `sync_metadata`.

### 4.7 Cloud Vault Schema & Migrations (`src/server/db/schema/vault.ts`, `src/server/db/migrations/0008_hybrid_vault_schema.sql`, `src/server/db/migrations/0009_add_device_trust_epoch.sql`)

- **`user_vault_profiles` Table**: Persists dual-wrapped master keys (`encrypted_master_key` via password KEK, `recovery_encrypted_master_key` via BIP-39 seed KEK), independent salts (`key_salt`, `recovery_salt`), PBKDF2 iteration configurations (600,000), and `device_trust_epoch` (integer default 1).
- **Migration 0009 (`0009_add_device_trust_epoch.sql`)**: Synchronizes the PostgreSQL cloud database with the `device_trust_epoch` counter, ensuring persistent state for remote device trust invalidation across all user devices.
- **`files` Table Encryption Metadata**: Adds `is_encrypted` boolean flag and structured `encryption_metadata` JSONB column (`version`, `algorithm`, `keyId`, `salt`, `iv`, `kdfIterations`) enabling the backend to identify encrypted assets and enforce Zero-Knowledge AI gatekeepers.

### 4.8 Trusted Device Dual Architecture: Hardware Biometrics (WebAuthn PRF) & 6-Digit PIN (`src/lib/sync/webauthn-prf.ts`, `src/lib/sync/encryption.ts`)

- **Dual-Tier Trust Options**: Users enabling "Trust This Device" can select between:
  1. **Hardware Biometrics (WebAuthn PRF — Recommended):** Binds the Master Key to the physical platform authenticator (Windows Hello via TPM 2.0, Apple Touch ID / Face ID via Secure Enclave, Android via Titan M2 / StrongBox) using W3C WebAuthentication Level 3 PRF extension (`extension:prf`). Derives an AES-GCM-256 KEK via HKDF-SHA-256 within the secure enclave, delivering complete physical immunity against offline `IndexedDB` disk extraction.
  2. **6-Digit PIN (Software Fallback):** Derives a KEK via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600,000 iterations, 16-byte random salt) strictly validating 6 decimal digits (`/^\d{6}$/`, $10^6$ combinations). Subject to TD-10 offline extraction boundary.
- **In-Place Dual Selector**: Available in both `TrustDeviceModal` and directly within `VaultUnlockModal` (Password tab), permitting users to enroll, reconfigure, or switch between Biometrics and PIN during standard password unlock.
- **Real-Time Capability & Diagnostic Feedback (`checkWebAuthnSupportStatus`)**: Dynamically queries `isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable()` and `getClientCapabilities()` (supporting both `"extension:prf"` and `"prf"` keys). If unavailable, provides actionable feedback (e.g., reminding users to configure a Windows Hello PIN in OS settings or access via secure localhost/HTTPS).
- **Device Trust Envelope Schema (`DeviceTrustEnvelope`)**: Persists wrapped key, salt, IV, epoch, and metadata with explicit discriminator `trustType: 'pin' | 'webauthn_prf'` and `credentialId`.
- **Anti-Brute-Force & Expiration Defense**: Enforces a strict 5-attempt failed-unlock lockout limit (`failedAttempts >= 5`) for PIN envelopes and a 30-day expiration window (`expiresAt = trustedAt + 30 days`).
- **Global Central Revocation (`revokeAllTrustedDevices`)**: Incrementing `deviceTrustEpoch` on the server atomically invalidates all local device trust envelopes (both PRF and PIN) across all devices simultaneously due to cryptographic AAD mismatch (`trusted_device:${userId}:${deviceTrustEpoch}`) upon unwrap.

### 4.9 Zero-Knowledge Operation & AI Streaming Guards

- **Client-Side Re-Encrypted Copy Engine (`copyFile` / AUD-02)**: Copying an encrypted file decrypts in volatile RAM, generates a new UUID and fresh random IV, and re-encrypts with the target AAD (`vault:file:${userId}:${newFileId}`). Server-side `copyFile` strictly rejects copying encrypted files without valid client-side re-encryption.
- **Zero-Knowledge AI Streaming Commit Guard (`commitAIFileOperation`)**: When committing AI generation to an encrypted file, the client encrypts the text locally before sending. The server action strictly rejects commits to encrypted files if unencrypted content is supplied without encryption metadata.
- **Conflict 412 Double-Encryption Prevention (AUD-03)**: Detects pre-authenticated ciphertext (`gcm:v1:...`) during server-version conflict resolution to eliminate double-encryption corruption loops.

### 4.10 Zero-Knowledge Log Hygiene & Diagnostic Trace Preservation (`src/lib/sync/log-sanitizer.ts`)

- **Denylist-Based Key Redaction**: Recursively redacts sensitive payload fragments (`content`, `plaintext`, `ciphertext`, `masterkey`, `password`, `pin`, `seed`, `mnemonic`) across error logs and metadata.
- **Word-Boundary Isolation**: Employs exact token boundary isolation for short cryptographic abbreviations (`iv`, `pin`, `aad`, `kek`, `pwd`) to eliminate false-positive redaction of benign operational properties (e.g. `activity`, `archive`, `privacy`).
- **Multi-Word Secret Scrubbing**: Scrubs assignment-style secrets spanning whitespace (e.g. 12-word BIP-39 mnemonics) up to field/newline delimiters, preventing word leakage to console or telemetry.
- **DAG Cycle Detection**: Uses depth-first enter/exit tracking (`seen.delete(obj)`) to detect recursive object cycles without falsely redacting shared diamond-node references across directed acyclic graphs.
- **Sanitized Stack Preservation**: Retains diagnostic call stacks within error payloads while stripping embedded credentials and key material.
- **Subsystem Integration**: Automatically integrated into `SyncErrorHandler` (sanitizing errors before console logging and callback notification) and `SyncPerformanceMonitor` (sanitizing metric metadata upon ingestion so memory stores never hold unencrypted payloads).

## 5. Protected Maintenance Crons & Distributed Locking

Scheduled maintenance routes execute background pruning and quota reclamation. To guarantee zero concurrency races across horizontal serverless instances and external schedulers, all cron handlers are protected by distributed locks (`src/lib/cron/lock.ts`) and constant-time bearer authentication.

### 5.1 Distributed Cron Lock Architecture (`src/lib/cron/lock.ts` / LUGX-096, LUGX-120)

- **Atomic Key Acquisition (`acquireCronLock`):** Utilizes Upstash Redis `SET cron:lock:<jobName> <workerId> NX EX <ttlSeconds>`. The atomic command ensures only a single execution instance can hold the lock during the designated TTL window.
- **In-Memory Fallback:** If Redis is unconfigured or unreachable, the subsystem degrades gracefully to an in-memory lock table tracking active jobs with expiration timestamps, preventing concurrent invocations in single-node/local runtimes.
- **Safe Overlap Skipping:** When a lock cannot be acquired because a previous execution is still running, handlers immediately return HTTP 200 `{ success: true, skipped: true, reason: "Overlapping execution prevented by distributed lock", timestamp: ... }`. Schedulers do not fail or retry aggressively.
- **Automatic & Manual Release:** The lock exposes a `.release()` method called in route `finally` blocks, while the TTL automatically expires the lock if a process crashes ungracefully.

### 5.2 Soft-Delete Tombstone Purge (`src/app/api/cron/purge-deleted/route.ts`)

Permanent purge of soft-delete tombstones past retention:

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Retention window | 30 days (`RETENTION_DAYS`) after `deleted_at` |
| Authorization | Shared secret: `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`; verified via constant-time `crypto.timingSafeEqual` comparison (LUGX-136), failing closed with 401 when unset, mismatched, or malformed |
| Concurrency Lock | Protected by `acquireCronLock("purge-deleted", 600)` with safe HTTP 200 `{ skipped: true }` overlap skipping |
| Bounded batches | Deletes at most **500 rows per run** via a `WITH doomed AS (… LIMIT 500) DELETE … USING` CTE (Drizzle's builder has no `.limit()`) |
| Method Parity | Full support for both `GET` and `POST` methods (`export const POST = GET;`) |
| Idempotency | Re-running only deletes rows already past the cutoff |
| Scheduling | Invoked externally (GitHub Actions daily workflow `.github/workflows/cron.yml` with decoupled jobs and backlog drain loop) |

### 5.3 Stale Quota Reservation Expiration (`src/app/api/cron/expire-reservations/route.ts` / TD-02)

Automated expiration of leaked or orphaned in-flight AI quota reservations:

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Stale threshold | 5 minutes (`STALE_THRESHOLD_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000`) past reservation timestamp |
| Target status | Records with status `'reserved'` in `ai_usage_history` |
| Transition | Updated atomically to status `'expired'` via `expireStaleReservations` |

## 7. Cryptographic Architecture Decisions & Trade-offs

### Decision TR-05: Web Worker PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600K) vs. WASM Argon2id

- **Context:** Deriving high-entropy encryption keys from user passwords for the client-side Zero-Knowledge Vault without blocking the editor UI thread or degrading bundle performance.
- **Chosen Architecture:** Dedicated background Web Worker (`src/lib/workers/crypto.worker.ts`) executing native `PBKDF2` with HMAC-SHA256 at **600,000 iterations** (OWASP recommended baseline) via the browser's native `SubtleCrypto` engine.
- **Rejected Alternative:** Compiling `Argon2id` via WebAssembly (WASM).
- **Trade-off Analysis:**
  | Evaluation Criteria | Chosen Solution (Web Worker PBKDF2) | Alternative (WASM Argon2id) |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Dependency Footprint** | **Zero External Dependencies**: Uses native browser Web Crypto API; 0 KB added to JavaScript bundle. | **Heavy**: Adds ~1.2MB–1.8MB binary WASM payload plus JavaScript loader glue. |
  | **Security Policy (CSP) Friction** | **Zero**: Executes cleanly under strict Content Security Policies (`script-src 'self'`). | **High**: Frequently blocked by enterprise CSP rules disallowing `wasm-eval` or external WASM compilation. |
  | **GPU Resistance** | **Moderate**: Computationally expensive for CPUs (600K rounds), but theoretically more parallelizable on GPUs than memory-hard Argon2. | **Maximum**: Memory-hard design provides superior resistance against ASIC/GPU cracking. |
  | **Execution Isolation** | **Complete**: Background Web Worker prevents 600K hashing from freezing CodeMirror typing input. | **Complete**: Also offloaded to worker. |

- **Migration Trigger (When to Switch to Argon2id):**
  Migrating to Argon2id is triggered **when the W3C Web Cryptography Working Group formally ratifies Argon2id into native browser `SubtleCrypto` implementations**, eliminating the need for third-party WebAssembly binary blobs.

### Decision TR-06: Volatile RAM Raw `Uint8Array` vs. Non-Extractable `CryptoKey`

- **Context:** Securely holding master encryption keys in client volatile memory during active user editing sessions.
- **Chosen Architecture:** Maintaining keys in `SessionKeyStore` (`src/lib/sync/session-key-store.ts`) as raw `Uint8Array` byte buffers, augmented with strict multi-tab broadcast synchronization and explicit `.fill(0)` memory sanitization via `wipeBuffer()`.
- **Rejected Alternative:** Restricting key storage exclusively to non-extractable (`extractable: false`) `CryptoKey` objects.
- **Trade-off Analysis:**
  - **Thread-Boundary Transferability:** `CryptoKey` instances cannot be transferred across Web Worker boundaries via standard `postMessage` in all browser engines without re-exporting raw bytes or structured-clone duplication.
  - **Deterministic Memory Sanitization:** A `CryptoKey` object is an opaque black-box managed by the browser engine's internal garbage collector. When a user locks their vault or signs out, JavaScript cannot force the browser engine to overwrite the underlying cryptographic memory. In contrast, storing raw `Uint8Array` enables instant, deterministic zeroing of the memory buffer via `.fill(0)` across all open tabs simultaneously upon receiving `vault_locked`.

### Decision TR-07: AES-GCM-256 with Domain AAD Binding vs. Envelope Encryption

- **Context:** Encrypting user Markdown document content before transmission to cloud storage.
- **Chosen Architecture:** Direct `AES-GCM-256` with mandatory Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) binding formatted canonically as `vault:file:${userId}:${fileId}`.
- **Rejected Alternative:** Envelope Encryption (generating per-file Data Encryption Keys wrapped by a Master Key via KMS).
- **Trade-off Analysis:**
  - **Hardware Acceleration:** Native `AES-GCM-256` leverages hardware AES-NI instructions in modern CPUs, enabling near-instant encryption/decryption on multi-megabyte notes.
  - **Ciphertext Substitution Prevention:** The strict domain AAD binding cryptographically binds the ciphertext to the exact owning user ID and file ID. If an adversary attempts to swap an encrypted payload from one file into another, or across different tenants in the database, `SubtleCrypto.decrypt` fails unconditionally with `OperationError`.
