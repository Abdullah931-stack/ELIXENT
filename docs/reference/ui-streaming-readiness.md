# UI Streaming Architecture & Implementation Specification

## 1. Executive Overview

This document specifies the architecture and implementation of the **Hybrid Streaming & Snapshot Architecture** in the LUGX platform, restoring real-time perceived UI streaming while guaranteeing absolute data integrity, single-action atomic undo, idempotent quota accounting, and optimistic version protection.

### Primary System Invariant:
> **No network chunk is ever written directly to the active document state, the local IndexedDB database, or the remote database.**
> Streaming tokens update an isolated in-memory ephemeral buffer and view-layer preview overlay. The document is committed in exactly one atomic transaction only after stream completion and server version validation.

## 3. Dual Atomicity Model

To prevent distributed transaction failure modes, the system decouples commit into two deterministic phases:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client["Client Session: streaming -> preview_ready (Parked)"] --> UserChoice{"User Decision Trigger"}
    UserChoice -->|"Accept (commitPreview)"| Step1["Step 1: Server Commit (commitAIFileOperation)"]
    UserChoice -->|"Reject / Retry (rejectPreview)"| SettleConsumed["Settle Quota as Consumed (commitAIReservation)<br/>Dismantle Preview (Doc Pristine, No Refund)"]
    
    Step1 --> VerifyVer["Verify files.version == expectedVersion or Idempotent Commit"]
    Step1 --> VerifyOwnership["Verify Document & Reservation Ownership"]
    Step1 --> VerifyZK["Verify Vault Opt-In & Encryption Metadata (if encrypted)"]
    
    VerifyVer & VerifyOwnership & VerifyZK --> TxCommit["UPDATE files (content, version + 1, new etag)<br/>UPDATE credit_ledger_transactions (status = 'SETTLED' - idempotent)"]
    
    TxCommit -->|Version Conflict / 412 or Security Error| Rollback["Rollback ephemeral state locally (tokens already settled as consumed)"]
    TxCommit -->|Success (200 OK)| Step2["Step 2: Local Commit (Single Atomic Transaction)"]
    
    Step2 --> Dismantle["Dismantle Ephemeral Preview Overlay"]
    Step2 --> Replace["adapter.replaceRange(from, to, previewMarkdown)"]
    Step2 --> Undo["Push 1 History Stack Entry (Undoable with single Ctrl+Z)"]
    Step2 --> IDBSync["Sync to local IndexedDB with server ETag"]
```

## 4. Session Finite State Machine (FSM)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> idle
    idle --> reserving: startStream()
    reserving --> streaming: onMeta / onStart received
    streaming --> preview_ready: onDone received (Result parked, NO auto-commit)
    preview_ready --> committing: User ACCEPTS (commitPreview)
    committing --> committed: Local atomic Editor transaction
    committed --> idle: Session recycled

    streaming --> aborted: User STOPS (settle-as-consumed, never refund)
    preview_ready --> aborted: User REJECTS / RETRIES (settle-as-consumed)

    reserving --> failed: Startup / quota error (refund)
    streaming --> failed: Network / model error (refund)
    committing --> failed: Database commit error (refund)
    committing --> conflict: Version mismatch (HTTP 412, refund)
    
    aborted --> idle: Reset
    failed --> idle: Reset
    conflict --> idle: Reset
```

## 5. NDJSON Framing Protocol Specification

The `/api/ai/stream` endpoint streams framed newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) events over an HTTP response with headers `Content-Type: application/x-ndjson; charset=utf-8`:

### 5.0 Request Contract & Gatekeeper Validation
Requests to `/api/ai/stream` must provide the following JSON payload:
- `prompt` (string, required): The prompt text (max 100,000 characters).
- `operationId` (string, required): RFC 4122 UUID identifying the reservation for idempotency.
- `fileId` (string, required): Target document UUID. Missing or empty values fail closed with HTTP `400 Bad Request` (`MISSING_FILE_ID`).
- `context` (string, optional): Context string for generation.

#### Server-Side Validation Pipeline:
1. **Authentication:** Validates server session with `getUser()`. Returns HTTP 401 if unauthenticated.
2. **Mandatory fileId Check (LUGX-085):** Rejects missing/empty `fileId` with HTTP 400 (`MISSING_FILE_ID`).
3. **Database Ownership & State:** Queries `schema.files` for `id = fileId` AND `userId = user.id` AND `deletedAt IS NULL`. Missing files return HTTP 404.
4. **Zero-Knowledge Gatekeeper:** If `targetFile.isEncrypted`, queries `schema.userVaultProfiles`. If `allowAIOnEncryptedFiles` is not explicitly `true`, rejects with HTTP 403 (`AI_PROHIBITED_ON_ENCRYPTED_FILES`) before token consumption or quota reservation.
5. **Quota Reservation:** Passes validated non-null `fileId` into `reserveAndUpdateUsage`.

### 5.1 Meta Event
Emitted immediately upon successful quota reservation before AI generation starts:
```json
{"type":"meta","sessionId":"session_abc123","reservationId":"res_def456","operationId":"op_ghi789"}
```

### 5.2 Delta Event
Emitted for each incoming token or text chunk from Gemini:
```json
{"type":"delta","text":"Partial generated text..."}
```

### 5.3 Done Event
Emitted on clean EOF stream termination:
```json
{"type":"done"}
```

### 5.4 Error Event
Emitted if an error occurs during stream transmission:
```json
{"type":"error","code":"STREAM_FAILED","message":"Connection timed out","retryable":true}
```

## 6. Failure Recovery & Quota Idempotency

### 6.1 Server-Authoritative Quota Settlement (v1.39.0 / Phase 11)
Client financial authority is revoked: `refundAIReservation` and `commitAIReservation` are strictly internal server functions encapsulated in `src/server/services/ai-settlement-service.ts` (`server-only`) and cannot be invoked by clients. Settlement is driven authoritatively by `/api/ai/stream`:
- **Pre-TTFT System Failure / Disconnect (`ttftMs === null`):** Server triggers internal `refundAIReservation(operationId, reason)`:
  - **Condition:** Updates `status = 'refunded'` WHERE `operation_id = operationId AND status = 'reserved'`.
  - **Idempotency:** Subsequent calls find `status == 'refunded'` or `'committed'` and return `{ refunded: false, reason: "already_refunded" | "already_committed" }`, eliminating double-refund risks.
  - **Period Key Safety:** Reverts daily/weekly usage counters on the EXACT `periodKey` (UTC date) recorded at reservation time, preventing counter mismatches across midnight boundaries.
- **Post-TTFT Disconnect / Stream Completion (`ttftMs !== null`):** Server autonomously executes `commitAIReservation(operationId)` before `{ type: "done" }` or upon socket disconnect, settling quota as consumed for generated tokens.
- **Decoupled Document Commit (`commitAIFileOperation`):** User acceptance commits the file independently of whether the reservation was already settled as `committed` by the server stream handler.

### 6.2 Stale Reservation Sweeper (TTL)
`expireStaleReservations()` in `ai-settlement-service.ts` queries all `credit_ledger_transactions` where `status = 'SETTLED'`, `nodeName LIKE 'reserved:%'`, and `createdAt <= cutoff` (5-minute TTL). It transitions them to `ABORTED` with nodeName prefix `expired:` and refunds the reserved micro-credit amount back to `users.creditBalanceMicro`, ensuring abandoned client tabs do not leak quota balances. Authorized via `CRON_SECRET` on `/api/cron/expire-reservations`.

### 6.3 Streaming Terminality & Watchdogs (v1.5.0 Amendment)

Runtime remediation closed four compounding defects that produced an invisible ghost
preview and a perceived infinite send/receive deadlock (full root-cause matrix in
`AI_KEY_ROTATION_AND_STREAMING_RESILIENCE.md` §5a):

- **Single terminal callback, absolutely:** rejections inside the async atomic-commit
  pipeline are routed back into `onError` instead of becoming unhandled promise
  rejections — the ghost is always dismantled, the reservation refunded, and the in-flight
  trigger mutex released.
- **Provider-side cancellation:** the `AbortSignal` is forwarded into Gemini SDK request
  options, so aborts and disconnects terminate the upstream socket.
- **Watchdogs:** first-chunk (`20s`) and absolute-duration (`120s`) ceilings fail closed
  with structured errors (`AI_STREAM_FIRST_CHUNK_TIMEOUT`, `AI_STREAM_DURATION_EXCEEDED`).
- **Preview buffer integrity:** only the latest delta is appended to
  `EphemeralPreviewBuffer` (previously the accumulated text was re-appended per chunk,
  growing it quadratically).

New verification suites: `src/test/ai/ai-stream-completion-terminality.test.ts` (terminality,
watchdog fail-closed) and `src/test/ai/ai-client.test.ts` (signal reaches
SDK request options).

## 7. Configuration & Feature Flags

Feature flags are centralized in `src/config/features.config.ts`:
```typescript
export const FEATURES = {
    AI_STREAMING_ENABLED: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_STREAMING_ENABLED === "true",
    RESERVATION_TTL_MS: 5 * 60 * 1000,
    PREVIEW_BUFFER_MAX_CHARS: 500_000,
};
```
`AI_STREAMING_ENABLED` defaults to `false`; as of v1.5.0 the route handler actively
branches on it — when disabled, generation runs through the `processWithAI` buffered
accumulator path and is framed to the client as a single NDJSON chunk (identical wire
protocol, non-incremental delivery). All modules, schema migrations, and contracts remain
tested and ready for progressive canary activation by setting the flag to `true`.
