## Overview

**LUGX** is an enterprise-grade cloud text editing and linguistic intelligence workstation designed specifically for bilingual Arabic and English content. It combines real-time AI assistance (grammar correction, style enhancement, translation, summarization, and prompt engineering) with a native, distraction-free Markdown editor, deterministic offline-first synchronization, resilient concurrency control, and a rock-solid subscription engine.

### Key Capabilities

- ✍️ **Native Markdown Editor & Bidi Engine:** Built on CodeMirror 6 with live AST token decorations, line-level bidirectional isolation (`bidiLinePlugin`), three direction modes (`auto`, `rtl`, `ltr`), and code block LTR locking.
- 📴 **Custom Offline-First Synchronization:** User-partitioned IndexedDB storage (`textai_db_${userId}`), deterministic 3-way linear diff merge, SHA-256 ETag verification, bounded worker queues, automatic GC compaction, and atomic rollback snapshots.
- ⚡ **Dual-Phase Atomic Quota Reservation:** Eliminates TOCTOU race conditions with database-level conditional leases (`ai_reservations`), 60s TTL safety, and zero-bounded atomic refunds (`GREATEST(column - n, 0)`).
- 🤖 **Resilient AI NDJSON Streaming:** High-performance inline preview card (`CMStreamingGhostWidget`) positioned at exact document offsets with 60fps in-place DOM updates, 3-state decision triggers (`Accept`, `Reject`, `Retry`), and a distributed 3-state circuit breaker with multi-key API rotation.
- 💳 **Fail-Closed Stripe Subscriptions:** 8-state exhaustive webhook state machine with database-level uniqueness constraints preventing duplicate entitlements.
- 🛡️ **Smart Hybrid Database Client:** Dual-protocol architecture supporting `@neondatabase/serverless` (HTTP/WebSocket) for Neon Cloud serverless edges and `pg.Pool` (TCP) for local Docker, CI, and development environments.
- 🔒 **Zero-Knowledge Cloud Vault & Hybrid Encryption:** Client-side end-to-end encryption (`AES-GCM-256` with domain AAD `vault:file:${userId}:${fileId}`), Web Worker-isolated key derivation (`PBKDF2-SHA256` with 600K iterations), WebAuthn PRF hardware biometrics, 6-digit Quick PIN, 12-word BIP-39 recovery seed, transparent local IndexedDB encryption, and dual-layer AI safety gatekeepers.
- 📄 **Client-Side PDF & Multi-Modal Document Extraction:** 100% in-browser Web Worker text extraction (`pdfjs-dist`), 2D spatial clustering algorithm for automatic GitHub-Flavored Markdown tables, pure TypeScript Arabic Unicode normalization (de-spacing, un-shaping, BiDi correction), embedded font corruption detection (PUA range analysis), and on-demand bilingual OCR (`tesseract.js`).
- 📡 **Dual-Mode Rate Limiting & Distributed Tracing:** Redis sliding-window limiters with Fail-Open resilience on public and file-sync operations, Fail-Closed protection on AI streaming quotas, distributed `X-Correlation-ID` context propagation across Server Actions and Route Handlers with CRLF injection sanitization, and Zero-Knowledge log masking with token-boundary isolation.
- ⏱️ **Automated Quota & Maintenance Sweepers:** Scheduled crons for 30-day soft-delete purges (`/api/cron/purge-deleted`) and automated reclamation of expired AI quota leases (`/api/cron/expire-reservations`), resolving orphaned pending leases without manual intervention.

## Architectural Statement: Custom Ground-Up Synchronization Engine

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### Design Rationale & Concurrency Problem-Solving Mastery
>
> A defining engineering pillar of LUGX is its **custom, zero-dependency offline-first synchronization and concurrency engine** (`src/lib/sync/*`), designed and built entirely from scratch without relying on third-party synchronization frameworks or reference projects.

### 1. The Engineering Intent

The decision to build a ground-up synchronization engine was driven by the desire to demonstrate **deep algorithmic mastery over distributed state, optimistic updates, and concurrency conflict resolution** in web applications. The resulting engine implements:

- A linear **3-Way Line-Based Merge Algorithm** (`src/lib/sync/conflict-resolver.ts`) that cleanly reconciles concurrent non-overlapping local and remote edits without data loss.
- An **Append-Only Operation Log** tracking granular mutations (`insert`, `delete`, `update`, `create`, `rename`, `move`).
- A **Bounded Worker Queue** with concurrency throttles (4 workers) and exponential backoff with jitter to protect backend connection pools.
- An **Automated Garbage Collection & Compaction Subsystem** with a 7-day TTL window (`src/lib/sync/operations-gc.ts`).
- **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)** isolation and **Pre-Operation Rollback Snapshots** ensuring that failed sync operations never corrupt local document state.
- **Cross-Tab Synchronization** orchestrated via native `BroadcastChannel` APIs and centralized write controller guards (`src/hooks/use-editor-orchestrator.ts`).

### 2. Acknowledgment of Standard Solutions (e.g., Yjs)

We are fully aware of industry-standard collaborative editing and CRDT frameworks—most notably **Yjs**—which provide robust real-time shared editing capabilities, have first-class CodeMirror 6 bindings, and were evaluated during early architecture reviews.

The decision to implement a custom engine rather than adopting Yjs was a **deliberate and conscious design choice** grounded in four core factors:

1. **Project Scope & Focused Personal Utility:** In its current phase, LUGX is engineered as a high-caliber showcase for engineering mastery and as a dedicated tool solving a specific personal bilingual writing workflow. There is no immediate commercial or multi-user collaborative editing requirement that mandates full CRDT state vectors.
2. **Performance & Extreme Lightweight Footprint:** The custom sync engine is lean, purpose-built, and tightly coupled to raw Markdown text. It avoids the significant memory overhead, complex state vector serialization, and heavy bundle weight associated with general-purpose CRDT frameworks.
3. **Zero-Knowledge Cryptographic Incompatibility & Complexity:** Following the implementation of the Zero-Knowledge Cloud Vault, integrating CRDT state vectors would introduce immense cryptographic complexity. Reconciling decentralized encrypted CRDT updates across untrusted server infrastructure requires either complex peer-to-peer session key distribution or homomorphic operational convergence. In a single-user workstation, this imposes heavy memory overhead (tombstones) and device battery drain without functional ROI.
4. **Future Architectural Flexibility:** Clean abstraction boundaries were intentionally established across the system (`EditorAdapter` in `src/components/editor/markdown/editor-adapter.ts`, `useSync` in `src/hooks/use-sync.ts`, and `SyncManager` in `src/lib/sync/sync-manager.ts`). If the platform transitions to a commercial product requiring real-time multi-user live collaboration, the architecture is designed so that the sync layer can either be extended or seamlessly swapped for Yjs without requiring radical structural changes to the editor components, database schema, or UI.

_For the full comparative trade-off matrix, complexity analysis, and quantitative migration thresholds, see the canonical specification in [`docs/architecture/sync/three-way-conflict-resolution.md`](docs/architecture/sync/three-way-conflict-resolution.md)._

## Engineering Methodology

> **Deliberate Architecture & AI Orchestration**
>
> LUGX is designed, architected, and directed entirely by Abdullah through deliberate AI orchestration — every technical decision (data model, concurrency strategy, security posture, and trade-off analyses such as the Yjs evaluation in the [Architectural Statement](#architectural-statement-custom-ground-up-synchronization-engine)) originates from human judgment, domain expertise, and rigorous feasibility studies.
>
> Code implementation itself is delegated to and coordinated across advanced AI models under structured, specification-driven direction, with correctness enforced through systematic review gates (type-checking, linting, and 100% passing automated test suites) backed by targeted manual review of critical logic paths — rather than manual line-by-line authorship. This is a conscious engineering methodology choice: the discipline demonstrated throughout [`docs/`](./docs) — the phased execution protocol, the living technical debt register, and the design-vs-reality divergence log — reflects the same rigor a hands-on implementation requires, combined with the proven capability to orchestrate, audit, and systematically steer LLMs to produce robust, rigorously tested software.

## Core Engineering Subsystems

### 1. Standalone Markdown Editor & Bidirectional (Bidi) Engine

LUGX operates exclusively on pure **UTF-8 Markdown strings** (normalized via Unicode NFC and LF line endings), completely eliminating intermediate HTML parsing, serialization, and sanitization.

- **Engine-Agnostic EditorAdapter (`src/components/editor/markdown/editor-adapter.ts`):** Encapsulates the underlying CodeMirror 6 instance, exposing clean transactional methods (`getValue`, `setValue`, `replaceRange`, `getSelection`, `setSelection`).
- **Live Preview Decorations:** Markdown syntax tokens are dynamically hidden or styled using non-destructive CodeMirror 6 `Decoration.mark` overlays without mutating the underlying document buffer.
- **Bidirectional (Bidi) Engine (`src/components/editor/markdown/bidi-line-plugin.ts`):**
  - Implements line-level text direction analysis with 3 selectable modes: `auto` (auto-detects first strong RTL/LTR character per paragraph), `rtl`, and `ltr`.
  - Enforces **Code Block LTR Locking** (`lockCodeBlocksLTR`): Fenced code blocks (` ``` `) and inline code segments are strictly locked to LTR rendering regardless of surrounding Arabic text.
  - Direction controls integrated seamlessly via `DirectionMenu` in the editor toolbar.
- **Multi-Range Atomic Transactions in Search & Replace (`src/components/editor/search-replace.tsx`):**
  - Searches operate over UTF-16 document offsets.
  - `Replace All` batches all mutation targets into a single CodeMirror `ChangeSpec[]` transaction, preventing offset shifting and preserving complete undo/redo history.

### 2. Offline-First Synchronization & 3-Way Merge Engine

    style I fill:#FFF9C4,stroke:#FBC02D,stroke-width:1.5px
```

- **User-Partitioned IndexedDB (`src/lib/sync/indexeddb.ts`):** Client state is isolated per user (`textai_db_${userId}`), storing `files`, `operations`, and `sync_metadata`.
- **Deterministic 3-Way Merge Engine (`src/lib/sync/conflict-resolver.ts`):**
  - Compares Base Ancestor, Local Dirty State, and Server Remote State.
  - Non-overlapping line modifications are automatically merged and committed without user disruption.
  - Overlapping conflicts trigger the interactive visual split-diff dialog (`src/components/sync/conflict-dialog.tsx`).
- **Bounded Worker Queue & Resilience (`src/lib/sync/sync-manager.ts`):**
  - Concurrency is throttled to 4 parallel workers with adaptive exponential backoff and jitter.
  - Unrecoverable failures are isolated to the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ).
  - Pre-operation rollback snapshots (`snapshot`) ensure that failed synchronization attempts safely restore previous document state.
- **Automatic Garbage Collection (`src/lib/sync/operations-gc.ts`):** Prunes synced operation logs older than 7 days and compacts historical edits into clean baseline snapshots.

    style J fill:#FFF9C4,stroke:#FBC02D,stroke-width:1.5px
```

- **Dual-Phase Quota Reservation (`src/server/actions/ai-ops.ts`):**
  - Words are reserved prior to generation by creating an active lease in `ai_reservations` with a 60-second TTL.
  - Eliminates TOCTOU race conditions across distributed serverless functions.
  - Downstream system stream failures, timeouts, or pre-TTFT client aborts immediately trigger atomic, zero-bounded refunds (`GREATEST(column - n, 0)`). User-initiated aborts (`stopStream`) execute instantaneously (< 50ms) without blocking network calls, dismantling ghost decorations immediately while the server autonomously commits post-TTFT consumption per the Dual-Side Inversion Protocol (TD-05 & Explicit Settlement Policy §4-D).
- **Unified Inline Interactive Preview Card (`src/components/editor/markdown/streaming-ghost.ts`):**
  - Eliminates static top preview panels in favor of an inline CodeMirror 6 `WidgetType` positioned at the exact document mutation point.
  - Dynamic coordinate mapping via `tr.changes.mapPos` ensures preview decorations adjust smoothly to concurrent user edits.
  - Real-time action controls: `Stop Generation` during active streaming, followed by explicit decision buttons (`Accept`, `Reject`, `Retry`) upon stream completion.
- **Distributed Circuit Breaker & Key Pool (`src/lib/ai/key-rotation.ts`):**
  - 3-state circuit breaker (`CLOSED`, `OPEN`, `HALF-OPEN`) tracking failures in Upstash Redis.
  - Multi-key rotation pool with automated 4-tier model cascade: `gemini-3.7-flash` (primary) → `gemini-3.6-flash` (fallback) → `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (secondary) → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (tertiary).
- **Dual-Layer Quota Guard & Information Shielding (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts` & `src/app/api/ai/stream/route.ts`):**
  - Strict 30 requests / 60 seconds rate limiting via `aiStreamRateLimiter` failing closed upon Redis outages with `Retry-After >= 1`.
  - Information disclosure protection: Unhandled upstream model errors are shielded behind safe, standardized HTTP 500 envelopes containing the request's tracking `correlationId`, preventing internal provider stack leakage.

### 4. Smart Hybrid Database Client & Neon Isolated Test Infrastructure

- **Dual-Protocol Database Client (`src/lib/db/index.ts` & `src/lib/db/transactional.ts`):**
  - **Neon Serverless Protocol:** Uses `@neondatabase/serverless` over HTTP/WebSocket for ultra-low latency query execution in serverless edge runtimes.
  - **Node-Postgres Protocol:** Automatically falls back to standard `pg.Pool` over TCP when running in local Docker containers, CI pipelines, or non-Neon PostgreSQL environments, eliminating SSL connection pool mismatches.
- **Isolated Branching for Integration Tests (`src/test/test-db-guard.ts`):**
  - Live integration suites execute exclusively against a dedicated, isolated Neon test branch (`TEST_DATABASE_URL`).
  - Fail-closed runtime guards verify branch identity and refuse to boot against production databases.

### 5. Fail-Closed Stripe Subscription Lifecycle & State Machine

- **Exhaustive 8-State Mapping (`src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`):** Handles `active`, `trialing`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `unpaid`, `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, and `paused`.
- **Zero False Entitlements:** Unrecognized webhook payloads fail closed, aborting transaction execution rather than granting unwarranted tier upgrades.
- **Database-Level Idempotency (`src/lib/db/migrations/0004_stripe_constraints.sql`):** Partial unique index `idx_subscriptions_stripe_id_unique` guarantees that duplicate webhook deliveries cannot create duplicate active subscriptions for a single customer.
- **Atomic Audit Trail:** Webhook transactions record state transitions in `subscription_events` alongside user tier updates.

### 6. Scheduled Maintenance & Cron Automation

LUGX features fully automated, cryptographically secured background maintenance routines:

- **Automated Soft-Delete Purge (`src/app/api/cron/purge-deleted/route.ts`):** Permanently purges documents and folders marked as deleted (`deletedAt`) beyond the 30-day retention window.
- **Automated Expired Quota Reservation Sweeper (`src/app/api/cron/expire-reservations/route.ts`):** Continuously scans and expires orphaned `ai_reservations` held for longer than 60 seconds (resolving **TD-02**), releasing held quota back to users without manual intervention.
- **Secure Dual-Verb Dispatch:** Both endpoints support dual HTTP methods (`GET` for Vercel Cron, `POST` with Bearer token authentication against `CRON_SECRET` for GitHub Actions and external cron monitors) and are dispatched via `.github/workflows/cron.yml`.

### 7. Zero-Knowledge Cloud Vault & Client-Side Hybrid Encryption Subsystem

LUGX delivers a dual-tier client-side Zero-Knowledge encryption engine that keeps sensitive documents end-to-end encrypted at rest and in transit while maintaining full offline productivity.

```mermaid

    style AIGate fill:#FFEBEE,stroke:#C62828,stroke-width:1.5px
```

- **Dual-Tier Encryption Architecture:**
  - **Always-On Local At-Rest:** Transparent local encryption of IndexedDB tables using an ephemeral `LocalDeviceKey` generated on device.
  - **Zero-Knowledge Cloud Vault:** Sensitive documents are encrypted client-side using `AES-GCM-256` before hitting any network socket. PostgreSQL stores only ciphertext envelopes; the server possesses zero knowledge of the encryption keys.
- **Crypto Web Worker Isolation (`src/lib/workers/crypto.worker.ts`):**
  - CPU-intensive `PBKDF2-SHA256` derivation (600,000 rounds) is offloaded to a background worker to eliminate UI thread latency.
  - Cryptographic keys use non-extractable WebCrypto handles (`extractable: false`).
  - Temporary memory buffers are proactively wiped via `.fill(0)` in `finally` blocks across all key accessors.
- **Hardware Biometrics & 12-Word BIP-39 Recovery:**
  - **WebAuthn PRF & 6-Digit PIN:** Users can register trusted hardware authenticators (Touch ID, Windows Hello, Face ID) or use a 6-digit Quick PIN for instant unlock.
  - **BIP-39 Recovery Seed:** The Master Key is dual-wrapped with both the password and a 12-word mnemonic phrase, allowing account recovery without re-encrypting existing files.
- **Non-Blocking Sync & Conflict Isolation:**
  - Cloud conflicts on encrypted files while the vault is locked enter a safe `CONFLICT_LOCKED` state without blocking unencrypted file synchronization.
  - Once unlocked, a 3-way Diff3 merge executes with structural syntax integrity checks (`syntax-validator.ts`) before re-encrypting with a fresh CSPRNG IV.
- **Dual-Layer AI Safety Gatekeepers:**
  - Strict UI badge suppression and server-side HTTP 403 rejection on `/api/ai/stream` for encrypted files prevent accidental plaintext leaks to external model providers.

### 8. Client-Side Document Ingestion, Spatial Table Extractor & Arabic Normalization Pipeline

LUGX eliminates server-side PDF processing entirely, purging all legacy `pdf-parse` dependencies and heavy binary uploads. Document ingestion executes 100% inside the browser via isolated Web Workers, translating unstructured binary documents into structured, clean GitHub-Flavored Markdown.

    VaultOption -->|Encrypted Vault| VaultCrypto["cryptoWorkerBridge.encryptAESGCM()<br/>Deterministic AAD: vault:file:${userId}:${fileId}"]
    VaultCrypto --> ServerImport
```

- **Web Worker PDF Parsing (`src/lib/workers/pdf.worker.ts` & `src/lib/parsers/pdf-worker-bridge.ts`):** Offloads `pdfjs-dist` to an isolated worker thread. Per-page garbage collection (`page.cleanup()`) and document destruction (`pdfDoc.destroy()`) prevent V8 heap accumulation. Supports dual-mode execution (browser Web Worker vs. headless Node.js runner).
- **2D Spatial Markdown Table Extractor (`src/lib/parsers/pdf-table-extractor.ts`):** Detects multi-column tabular data using 2D geometric clustering (`Y_TOLERANCE = 3.5pt`, `COLUMN_GAP_THRESHOLD = 25pt`), handles RTL column reordering for Arabic tables, and produces standard GFM table markup (`| Col 1 | Col 2 |`). Configurable and toggleable via user settings (`pdf-settings.ts`) and dialog quick-actions.
- **Arabic Unicode Normalizer (`src/lib/parsers/arabic-normalizer.ts`):** Pure TypeScript normalizer that resolves disjointed Arabic glyphs via lookahead de-spacing (`\u0600-\u06FF`), normalizes presentation forms (NFKC), and preserves BiDi directionality across mixed English words, numbers, and dates.
- **Embedded Font Corruption Detection (`src/lib/parsers/pdf-corruption-detector.ts`):** Analyzes extracted characters against Unicode Private Use Area (PUA) ranges (`0xE000-0xF8FF`, `0xF0000-0x10FFFD`). Proactively alerts users when non-standard font encodings corrupt text and suggests visual OCR.
- **On-Demand Bilingual OCR Engine (`src/lib/parsers/pdf-ocr-engine.ts`):** Integrates dynamic `tesseract.js` with `ara+eng` trained data cached in Cache Storage. Renders PDF canvases at 2.0x scale with zero initial bundle bloat.
- **Direct Vault Encrypted Import:** Enables direct one-click ingestion into encrypted vaults. Files are encrypted client-side using `AES-GCM-256` with deterministic domain AAD (`vault:file:${userId}:${fileId}`) before leaving the browser.

### 9. Dual-Mode Rate Limiting, Log Sanitization & Distributed Correlation Tracing

To ensure enterprise-grade resilience under load and protect sensitive user secrets in distributed environments, LUGX implements a comprehensive telemetry, isolation, and throttling subsystem.

    style SafeErr fill:#FFEBEE,stroke:#C62828,stroke-width:1.5px
```

- **Distributed Correlation Tracing (`src/lib/utils/correlation.ts`):**
  - Generates RFC 4122 UUID v4 correlation identifiers when absent, extracts incoming `X-Correlation-ID` headers, and sanitizes characters against CRLF injection (`[^\w-]`).
  - Threaded through Next.js Server Actions via `operationId` in `FileOpResult` and propagated across downstream Route Handlers (`/api/files/sync`, `/api/ai/stream`).
  - Included in error responses to enable instant end-to-end incident debugging across client logs, server logs, and Redis monitors.
- **Dual-Mode Rate Limiting Engine (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`):**
  - **Public & Synchronization APIs:** Operates in **Fail-Open** mode (`onRateLimitError: 'allow'`). If Upstash Redis experiences network latency or downtime, document reads and offline-sync operations proceed uninterrupted.
  - **AI Streaming APIs (`aiStreamRateLimiter`):** Operates in **Fail-Closed** mode (`onRateLimitError: 'deny'`) with a strict 30 requests / 60 seconds limit. If the Redis rate limiter is unreachable, AI requests are rejected with a standardized `Retry-After: 60` response to prevent runaway LLM provider costs.
- **Zero-Knowledge Token-Boundary Log Sanitization (`src/lib/sync/log-sanitizer.ts`):**
  - Implements word-boundary denylist regex matching (`(^|[^a-zA-Z0-9_])`) to redact sensitive cryptographic tokens (`vaultKey`, `privateKey`, `seedPhrase`, `kek`, `salt`, `authorization`).
  - Eliminates false positives on benign identifiers (such as `key: value` or `keyboard`), guaranteeing that zero plaintext encryption secrets or session tokens leak into serverless runtime stdout or external observability drains.

### 10. Live Multi-System Integration & Isolated Database Test Infrastructure

To ensure platform-wide stability across complex asynchronous boundaries, LUGX deploys a dedicated, fail-closed integration tier executing against a real isolated Neon PostgreSQL database branch (`ep-dry-rain-b1kfmpgk-pooler`) and Upstash Redis instances with zero persistence-layer mocks.

- **Serialized Execution Invariant (`vitest.live.config.mts`):** Integration suites execute under `singleFork: true` serialization to prevent concurrent database teardown races and connection pool starvation across suites.
- **Fail-Closed Database Guard (`src/test/test-db-guard.ts`):** Enforces strict endpoint inspection before connection pool creation, terminating execution immediately if credentials point to main production branches or non-test hosts.
- **Seven Core Multi-System Integration Axes Verified:**
  1. *Files & Sync Lifecycle:* Real row initialization, debounced auto-save persistence, 3-way Diff3 merge resolution, and deterministic ETag generation.
  2. *AI Happy Path & Atomic Commit:* Quota reservation leases, streaming NDJSON with correlation tracing, and atomic ACID commits (file version bump + quota settlement + usage advancement) in a single database transaction.
  3. *AI Failure & Quota Sweeper (TD-02):* Upstream provider error handling, client abort propagation, single-refund idempotency, and automated cron sweepers (`/api/cron/expire-reservations`) with bounded 100-row batch execution.
  4. *Stripe Billing & Event Ledger:* Live HMAC signature verification, ACID event deduplication in `subscription_events`, and terminal state protection.
  5. *Zero-Knowledge Encrypted Vault:* Client-side AES-GCM-256 encryption, deterministic AAD context binding `vault:file:${userId}:${fileId}`, optimistic concurrency control on ciphertext versions, and HTTP 403 AI shielding.
  6. *Document Ingestion Pipeline:* Disguised binary rejection (PE/ELF/ZIP magic bytes), PostgreSQL null-byte scrubbing, and 100% round-trip fidelity.
  7. *Tenant Isolation & Security Boundary:* 404 Anti-Enumeration masking across unauthorized files, folders, and stream operations.
- **Consolidated 8-Stage Lifecycle Scenario (`src/test/infrastructure/multi-system-lifecycle.live.test.ts`):** Validates all platform subsystems combined in an end-to-end sequential scenario under live transactional conditions.

### 11. Browser-Driven End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Playwright

To validate full platform functionality under real user conditions, LUGX implements an automated browser test harness built on **Playwright v1.63.0** executing in headless Chromium against an isolated Next.js web server (`port: 3001`) and the dedicated Neon PostgreSQL test branch (`TEST_DATABASE_URL`).

- **Deterministic User Journey Execution:** 14 test specification suites under `e2e/specs/` cover 15 exhaustive user journeys, including SSR cookie authentication, nested folder operations, CodeMirror 6 BiDi typography, offline-first sync with conflict dialogs, client-side PDF extraction, AI streaming and atomic commit, user aborts/rejections (no refund), system AI failures (full refund), 412 collisions, zero-knowledge vault setup and auto-lock, AI shield HTTP 403 gating, Stripe billing ledger updates, and 404 anti-enumeration tenant isolation.
- **Hermetic Isolation & Teardown Invariant:** Every E2E test runs with timestamped test user credentials (`9999...`), followed by explicit teardown via `cleanupE2EUser()` ensuring zero persistent database pollution and zero cross-test interference.
- **Zero-Flakiness Guarantee:** Achieved 100% pass rate (15/15 journeys passed) across two consecutive automated validation runs (Run 1: 2.4m, Run 2: 2.1m), officially resolving technical debt item **TD-07**.

## Deployment Blueprints

### Vercel (Recommended)

Deploy directly with Vercel Next.js App Router support. Vercel automatically detects `vercel.json` for cron scheduling and handles edge caching.

### GitHub Actions Scheduled Cron

Ensure `CRON_SECRET` and `DEPLOY_URL` are added to your repository's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**. The `.github/workflows/cron.yml` workflow triggers daily soft-delete purging (03:00 UTC) and expired quota reservation sweeps automatically.

### Self-Hosted Docker / Linux Server

Schedule maintenance with system cron jobs:

```bash
# Daily 03:00 UTC - Soft-delete purge
0 3 * * * curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://your-domain.com/api/cron/purge-deleted

# Every 10 minutes - Orphaned AI reservation sweeper
*/10 * * * * curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://your-domain.com/api/cron/expire-reservations
```
